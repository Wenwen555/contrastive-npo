["be looking and asking ourselves some tough questions - about what it might look like.\"\n\nTheresa May commissioned the review to find better value for money for students\n\nIn the months before her departure from office, she said the \"basic architecture\" of an alternative funding system was worked up.\n\nThe proposal was for a system without fees, loans, debts or interest rates.\n\nInstead, graduates would pay back a proportion of earnings over a fixed number of years, with this graduate contribution funding universities.\n\nShe likens it to a time-limited form of National Insurance deductions, but only for graduates.\n\nIt would remove negative perceptions over high fees and \u00a350,000 average debts on graduation - and would prevent a cap on the number of places.\n\nMs Greening says poorer students had so far not been significantly deterred by fees, but it was \"getting to the point where it felt that they were too high\".\n\nShe argues her graduate contribution proposals would be more progressive - as higher earners would pay more.\n\n\"There could be someone going off into the City and paying off their loan and avoiding all the interest with one bonus cheque - compared to a nurse,\" she says, who could be paying it off for 30 years.\n\nThe graduate contribution would keep the principle of students paying towards higher education.\n\n\"Most students recognise they should make a contribution, because they're getting an opportunity,\" she says.\n\nBut it would mean ditching the idea of a higher education marketplace in fees, which was at the heart of the reforms that created the tuition fee system.\n\n\"You have to confront the fact - did universities compete on price? No,\" she says.\n\nBut her plans for such a massive change went nowhere.\n\n\"We were working up this proposal before the reshuffle,\" she says.\n\n\"Of course, it had tons of work to be done, all sorts to refine and understand the trade-offs,\" but she believed it to be a \"more sensible approach\".\n\nInstead she was replaced as education secretary and a review of student finance was announced.\n\nShe has since set up the \"Social Mobility Pledge\", working to improve opportunities in the workplace, and is on the front lines of arguments over Brexit - supporting calls for a second referendum.\n\nLooking at policy over tuition fees, she says the divisions over Brexit show how ineffective the party political system has become at reaching long-term decisions.\n\n\"I don't think Britain or British politics will ever be the same again.\n\n\"I think it's a sea change. It's a call to action to genuinely create a different country to tackle some of the problems that sat behind a lot of the Brexit vote.\n\n\"And I think for British politics, we've got to ask ourselves some difficult questions about why party politics seemingly cannot rise to the challenge of delivering on long-term problems.\"\n\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"Students rightly expect value for money from their degree, which is why the government is conducting a major review of post-18 education and funding - to ensure we have a system that is joined up, accessible to all and provides value for money for both students and taxpayers.\n\n\"Work on the review is still ongoing, and more information will be available in due course.\"The world-famous waterfall is transformed into a winter wonderland as a cold snap presents shivering tourists with breathtaking views.The Knight & Lee store opened in Southsea in 1865 and was acquired by the John Lewis Partnership in 1933\n\nJohn Lewis is to close its first store since 2006.\n\nThe retailer said the 35,000 sq ft Knight & Lee outlet in Southsea in Hampshire was its smallest full-range department store and could not easily be modernised.\n\nJohn Lewis has previously acknowledged the \"challenges\" facing the High Street in the current retail climate.\n\nHowever, it insisted it was not planning any other closures at the moment.\n\nThe store, which will close in July, is one of only two John Lewis shops in the UK to retain its original name.\n\nThe retailer said the size and condition of the building \"restricts the customer offer\".\n\nEarlier this year, Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, outlined the challenges facing shopkeepers: \"Two main factors are affecting the retail sector - oversupply of physical space and relatively weak consumer demand.\"\n\nHe said full-year profits would be \"substantially\" lower this year and that staff, known as partners, might not be receiving an annual bonus this year, for the first time since 1953.\n\nOther retailers have been harder hit by the downturn on the nation's High Streets.\n\nOnline giants such as Amazon have had a huge impact, as more consumers see online shopping as cheaper and easier than going to the shops.\n\nThe trade body for shops, the British Retail Consortium, said 2018 saw the worst Christmas for retailers in 10 years.\n\nJohn Lewis actually saw a rise in Christmas sales year-on-year, but it has previously said that its profit margins are being squeezed by the need to match rivals' discounts.\n\nDespite this, it has dismissed the suggestion that it should abandon its \"never knowingly undersold\" price pledge.\n\nThe Knight & Lee store opened in Southsea in 1865 and was acquired by the John Lewis Partnership in 1933.\n\nIt was closed on Wednesday for a staff meeting, when employees were told of the plans.\n\nA statement from the company said it would require \"significant investment\" to modernise.\n\nJohn Lewis has acknowledged that it faces challenges\n\nDino Rocos, partner and operations director, said: \"We have not taken this decision lightly and we considered every implication for our partners, customers and the community.\n\n\"However, a unique combination of factors, including the significant investment required and the opportunity to sell the property freehold, makes this the right decision for the financial sustainability of our business.\"\n\nPortsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan said the closure would \"rip the heart out\" of Southsea.\n\nIn a letter to the company, Mr Morgan said the shop was a \"well-loved asset\" in the area.\n\n\"John Lewis is much cherished and causes a significant footfall which has a beneficial impact on the surrounding businesses and our local economy,\" he said.\n\nThe retailer said every effort would be made to find the 127 staff roles in nearby John Lewis and Waitrose stores.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.The woman was hit by the marked car in Walthamstow shortly before midnight\n\nA 26-year-old refugee from Eritrea died when she was hit by a police car responding to a 999 call.\n\nThe pedestrian was struck by the marked vehicle on Forest Road, Walthamstow, east London, at 23:45 GMT on Tuesday.\n\nOfficers stopped and tried to help the woman, but she was pronounced dead at the scene when paramedics arrived, the Met said.\n\nThe YMCA St Paul's Group confirmed the woman had been a resident at YMCA Walthamstow for the past 18 months.\n\nIt said it was \"shocked and saddened\" by her death and was supporting its residents and staff with counselling.\n\nGilbert James, 44, who lives on Forest Road, said he \"heard a loud bang and police sirens\".\n\nWhen he came out to investigate he said he \"saw the person lying on the floor\" and the police car windscreen \"completely smashed\".\n\nForest Road was closed while investigations took place\n\nPav Kaur, who lives nearby, said there was \"a very sombre atmosphere\" in the area.\n\nPolice are trying to trace the woman's next of kin, who are thought to live outside the UK.\n\nThe car had been responding to reports of a man threatening members of the public, Scotland Yard said.\n\nBy the time officers arrived the man had left the scene.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has launched an investigation, said \"two people apparently walked into the road\" as the police vehicle travelled along Forest Road.\n\n\"One of the pedestrians was struck and sadly passed away,\" the IOPC said.\n\nForest Road reopened shortly after 09:00 this morning and traffic has been flowing through like it would on any morning.\n\nThe remnants of blue and red police tape attached to a few lam", "study shows that 86% of consumers only look at labels for factual information and branding with 80% saying they would like to see less cluttered labels.\"\n\nHe said the Portman Group continually updates guidance to alcohol producers so consumers are provided \"with accurate and accessible health information\".Call the midwife in Nairobi, Kenya, and you may receive a visit from someone like Margaret Wairimu Maina.\n\nShe sets off on foot looking something like an astronaut, carrying a backpack stuffed full of hi-tech gadgets designed to monitor a baby's health.\n\nThe pack includes a wind-up foetal doppler used for measuring the baby's heartbeat, a portable ultrasound screen, a life-light with matching solar panel, in-ear thermometers, and a range of other medical instruments related to pregnancy.\n\nThe gear has become crucial for her voluntary job as a community health worker.\n\nAlthough the backpack weighs just 5kg (11lb) it's still a heavy load as she does her rounds twice a week, says Margaret. She is responsible for more than 120 households in the local area and manages to see up to 20 a day when she visits between noon and 4pm.\n\n\"I have two sons, aged five and 11,\" she says. \"Both of my pregnancies were very OK with no complications because I started my ante-natal care visits after only two months, and I had a skilled attendant around for delivery.\"\n\nMany other women in the country are not so lucky.\n\nIn Kenya, unlike other African countries such as Ethiopia, primary health care is not paid for by the government or local authority.\n\nMargaret works out of the Kiambu Community Life Centre north of Nairobi, where voluntary health workers are the first point of contact for those seeking medical help.\n\nMany women in Kenya don't have any access to medical care\n\n\"In large parts of Africa, people like Margaret are unpaid volunteers who often lack formal training or even basic equipment to help them with their tasks,\" says Jasper Westerink, chief executive of Philips Africa, the firm that developed the backpack.\n\n\"For years, we have had strong focus on mother and child care in Africa.\"\n\nWorking with local government, Philips is developing a number of community life centres to support community health workers and midwives equipped with these hi-tech backpacks.\n\n\"Our ambition is to introduce this model throughout Africa to drastically improve access to primary care,\" says Mr Westerink.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Nairobi lies Kibera. It is the biggest slum in Africa and though officially home to 500,000 people, some estimate it might actually hold two million inhabitants.\n\nKibera is an open sewer with little or no sanitation - a random matrix of undulating roads and paths that ambulances cannot access.\n\nIn fact, the only thing close to an ambulance is an improvised wheelbarrow with a yellow siren attached to its handles. Patients are placed in the cart and the lucky ones are wheeled to the community health clinic.\n\nBut in the remote region of Mandera, on Kenya's north-eastern border between Somalia and Ethiopia, pregnant women don't even have the option of a wheelbarrow ambulance.\n\nIt takes two days to reach the area by road from Nairobi and the infant mortality rate here is one of the highest in the world with almost 4,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 births.\n\nIn the remote parts of north-east Kenya often the only way to travel is by camel\n\nPublic transport is so expensive here that travelling by camel is the only option for pregnant women. It's not surprising that by the time they finally reach a doctor, they are not only in great danger of losing their unborn child, they are at great risk themselves.\n\nA new clinic was established in the region last year through a partnership between the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Mandera county's local government and Philips.\n\n\"Maternal and newborn health outcomes in Kenya's remote six counties contribute nearly 50% to all maternal deaths in Kenya and we want to stop that with centres such as these,\" says Dr Ademola Olajide of UNFPA.\n\nThe remoteness of these regions means that portable health monitoring technologies with mobile connectivity are proving invaluable to local volunteers, who can now access knowledge and advice from experts far away.\n\nFor example, in Ghana, the Ghana Health Service and Novartis Foundation are co-operating to develop a nationwide \"telemedicine\" programme by 2019.\n\nCommunity health workers can access specialists - doctors, nurses and midwives - through a 24-hour teleconsultation centre. It began as a pilot in a remote part of the Ashanti region in 2011, covering 30 communities of around 35,000 people.\n\nNow Novartis says there are enough teleconsultation centres to serve the entire country.\n\nIn another example, Uganda's MamaOpe has developed a Smart Vest application for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of pneumonia in young children. The disease can often be misdiagnosed as malaria.\n\nHealth workers in Ghana can access expert advice over the phone when helping patients\n\nIn a matter of minutes, the data collected is sent to doctors who can make a diagnosis quickly and cheaply.\n\nAnd smartphones are being used a diagnostic tools in their own right, testing for hearing loss, for example.\n\nPlugged in to services such as IBM's supercomputer Watson, with its ability to absorb vast swathes of clinical and social data and come up with likely prognoses, they are giving local community health workers access to knowledge they would never previously have had.\n\nBut while such technology may be impressive, it would of little use without the heroic efforts of volunteer health workers such as Margaret Wairimu Maina.\n\nHer work isn't always easy, she admits.\n\n\"Sometimes I find it very difficult emotionally to go into the community and interact with people who are very underprivileged, with little or no resources,\" she says.\n\n\"But that is what I must do, and it makes me feel happy to be useful and known in the community.\"Ambassador Jes\u00fas Silva has been in Caracas for less than a year\n\nVenezuela has expelled the Spanish ambassador to Caracas, Jes\u00fas Silva Fern\u00e1ndez, accusing him of interfering in its internal affairs.\n\nSpain has rejected the allegations and said it would reciprocate.\n\nThe announcement comes after the European Union imposed a travel ban and froze the assets of seven senior Venezuelan officials.\n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has accused Spain of pushing for the EU sanctions and plotting to oust him.\n\nThe EU has expressed concern over human rights violations during anti-government protests in which more than 120 people were killed last year.\n\nOn Tuesday Venezuela's Constituent Assembly announced that it was calling early presidential elections.\n\nForeign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the move was in reaction to the EU sanctions.\n\nThe vote, which is traditionally held in December, will take place by the end of April.\n\nMr Maduro told supporters that the US and Spain were trying to bring down his government\n\nMr Maduro, who will stand for another six-year term, said it was time \"to put an end to the imperialist threat\".\n\nVenezuela has the world's highest inflation rate and has for years struggled with the shortage of basic goods, including medicines.\n\nMr Maduro blames \"international economic sabotage\" - which he said was led by Spain and the US - for the situation.\n\n\"Donald Trump won't make decisions in Venezuela, [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy won't make decisions in Venezuela. The people of Venezuela will,\" he told thousands of his supporters at a rally in Caracas on Tuesday.\n\nLast month Venezuela expelled the Brazilian and the Canadian ambassadors to Caracas, also accusing them of interference.\n\nBrazil and Canada retaliated by expelling their respective Venezuelan ambassadors.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA coroner was wrong to restrict the scope of inquests into the Birmingham pub bombings, a court has ruled.\n\nIn July, coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC decided the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of new inquests.\n\nBut at the High Court on Friday, Mrs", "to be seen if his 854th professional match was his last.\n\nNow Murray has a dilemma to resolve - analysis\n\nIn Murray's 15 years as a professional, he has written some improbable scripts - and tonight, in front of a delirious crowd, he threatened to overturn a two set deficit once more.\n\nSets three and four were, in many ways, a microcosm of his career.\n\nMurray screamed in celebration, and in frustration.\n\nHe covered acres of ground with some sparkling defence.

But here we will focus on the situation of Britons living in another EU country (in the EU27).\n\nAbout 1.3m UK-born people are resident in the EU27, while the UK hosts about 3.2m EU27 nationals.\n\nThe withdrawal deal would enable them to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights, until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period ends.\n\nAs for no deal, there is huge uncertainty about what it will mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThe priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.\n\nThe European Commission, in its contingency plan for no-deal Brexit, urges the EU27 to \"take a generous approach to the rights of UK citizens in the EU, provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK\".\n\nIt says the EU27 \"should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status\".\n\nThere is uncertainty over how a no deal would affect flights in Europe\n\nThe Commission - the EU executive - has proposed visa-free travel for British visitors to the EU, provided the UK reciprocates.\n\nUnder the political declaration agreed alongside the withdrawal deal the UK says \"the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply\" after the transition.\n\nIt speaks of \"non-discrimination\" and \"full reciprocity\" and says both sides \"aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits\".\n\nHowever, that declaration is not legally binding; it spells out ambitions for the future UK-EU relationship, yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder no deal, the declaration would be null and void. The UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a \"third country\" like other non-EU states.\n\nSo the rules for Britons in the EU could well be the same as for Americans or Chinese - it will depend on the rules of the individual member states.\n\nSome of them have announced interim measures to protect UK citizens in the case of a no-deal Brexit, but they are generally only temporary, for example, Spain will offer transitional measures for 21 months after Brexit, Germany offers protection for nine months and France will put them in place for one year.\n\nBritish workers are integral to Airbus airliner production in Europe\n\nNo deal would immediately hit Britons whose work currently takes them to more than one EU country.\n\nThey would no longer be on a level playing field vis-a-vis EU citizens, who can easily move to another EU country and start a new job there. For Britons, post-Brexit, there will be more bureaucracy.\n\nMobility in Europe is important for many private sector workers, especially in the tech sector, such as computer game designers.\n\nSpecialists involved in pan-European research projects also need to be able to travel easily across the EU, often at short notice.\n\nDaniel Tetlow of campaign group British in Germany says \"Brits are now being discriminated against in job applications\".\n\nPost-Brexit, he said: \"I have the right only to continue working in Germany - I'm effectively landlocked.\n\n\"This has huge career implications for all UK citizens, not just those living in the EU, as is often misunderstood,\" he told the BBC. British in Germany is part of the coalition British in Europe.\n\nIt is not clear which UK professional qualifications will be recognised in the EU post-Brexit, and vice versa. Those details are yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder the withdrawal deal, British students in the EU27 can continue under the current system. But from 2021 they may face much higher tuition fees - those that non-EU students have to pay. Only Germany and Norway (which applies EU rules) offer free tuition for international students.\n\nJob search in Berlin: Conditions will change for British jobseekers\n\nNo deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply.\n\nIt could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU.\n\nNo deal would most likely delay the registration of some medicines and/or delivery of them.\n\nBritons could find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that post-Brexit, if a UK national moves to the EU, access to benefits will depend on the host country's immigration policy and the terms of any bilateral social security agreement it has with the UK.\n\nIn the EU, social security contributions are co-ordinated. So someone who has worked in more than one member state can make just one application to the relevant agency where they are living when they reach pension age. That agency notifies any other EU state where the individual has worked, and the national insurance contribution that he/she paid there becomes part of the pension.\n\nThat reciprocity disappears under a no-deal scenario. It is not clear whether any old bilateral UK deals with individual EU states on social security will be revived.\n\nThe UK tax treatment of overseas pension transfers could change post-Brexit. Transfers from the UK to non-EU countries have been subject to a 25% UK \"overseas tax charge\" since 2017. There is no guarantee that tax-free transfers will continue for UK pensioners living in the EU.\n\nWhat about the EU27 countries where most UK citizens live?\n\nOf the estimated 310,000 Britons living in Spain, about 65,000 are resident and in permanent work. About one-third of the 310,000 are pensioners.\n\nNo deal would be much less of a problem for a Briton with dual nationality. But Spain does not allow it - except for veterans of the 1930s left-wing International Brigades and Sephardi Jews who can prove a family connection with Spain. For other Britons, acquiring Spanish citizenship means surrendering a UK passport.\n\n\"Third country\" nationals in Spain have to prove annual income of at least \u20ac26,000 (\u00a323,000; $30,000) to remain leg", "of people.\n\nThe other two members of the group - also from London - were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed \"Jihadi John\", and Aine Davis.\n\nMohammed Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike and Aine Davis was sentenced to prison in Turkey.\n\nAll four were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria.\n\nThis judgement paves the way for the two Londoners to be prosecuted in the USA - after a fraught series of talks over what to do with them.\n\nDocuments in the case show that the US administration became frustrated with the UK's refusal to take the men back while trying to tell it what to do with them if they were instead to face justice in America.\n\nIn fact, the British ambassador in Washington warned President Trump could \"hold a grudge\" if the UK persisted in asking for a death penalty assurance.\n\nMs Elgizouli's lawyers argued that the UK's long-standing opposition to the death penalty was therefore cast aside in the interests of political expediency.\n\nBut today's judgement underlines that no law has been broken. Mr Elsheikh is not British - nor is he under UK control - so the obligations on ministers to act on his mother's concerns are limited.\n\nIn the past, Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects.\n\nIn this case, intelligence was shared with the US but no such assurances were sought.\n\nHowever, information sharing was halted last month after Mr Elsheikh's mother launched a legal challenge.\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"My priority has always been to ensure we deliver justice for the victims' families and that the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes face prosecution as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Our longstanding opposition to the death penalty has not changed.\n\n\"Any evidence shared with the US in this case must be for the express purpose of progressing a federal prosecution.\"\n\nMs Elgizouli's solicitor said that she found the decision difficult to take on board.\n\nGareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, said that while Ms Elgizouli thinks her son should be prosecuted, she argues that it should take place within accordance of international human rights standards.\n\n\"Ms Elgizouli hopes that the opportunity will be given for the Supreme Court to consider whether it has a greater ability to explore the important factors raised in the case she has brought,\" Ms Peirce said.Arif Ansari checked his reporter's script before it was broadcast, the court has heard\n\nBBC Asian Network's head of news has been found not guilty over the naming of a sexual abuse victim in a live radio broadcast.\n\nArif Ansari checked and approved a reporter's script which named the woman, believing it was a pseudonym.\n\nVictims of sexual offences are given lifetime anonymity by law.\n\nAfter a two-day case Mr Ansari was found not guilty by a district judge at Sheffield Magistrates' Court, who said the broadcast was an \"honest mistake\".\n\nMr Ansari was on trial accused of breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992. He denied the charge.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \"From the start we have accepted that mistakenly naming a victim of sexual abuse during a live broadcast last February was a serious mistake.\n\n\"The CPS had a choice to charge the BBC and/or the editor. We firmly believe that it should have been the BBC itself answering in court for this mistake, rather than the individual editor.\n\n\"We are relieved with the court's decision today.\"\n\nThe charge related to a live radio broadcast on 6 February last year.\n\nThe journalist involved in the broadcast, Rickin Majithia, had gone to Sheffield Crown Court to hear evidence in a trial linked to the Rotherham sex abuse scandal when a victim's real name was used, the court heard on the opening day of Mr Ansari's trial.\n\nMr Majithia told the district judge, Naomi Redhouse, that he wrongly thought the name used was a pseudonym.\n\nHis report, including the name which was described as a pseudonym, was broadcast as part of a live news bulletin and the woman - who was a victim of the Rotherham abuse - was listening to the radio when her name was read out. She said she went into \"full meltdown\", the court heard.\n\nThe charge was brought against Mr Ansari, in his capacity as editor. Mr Ansari had the role of checking and approving the script before it was broadcast, the court heard.\n\nGiving evidence to a judge sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Friday, Mr Ansari, 44, said he considered reporter Mr Majithia to be an excellent colleague who was very driven.\n\n\"I trusted his journalism,\" Mr Ansari said. \"He was a good journalist.\n\n\"This was not a complex legal issue. This is as basic as it gets. This is what journalists are taught at journalism school.\"\n\nMr Ansari added: \"It just struck me as 100% accurate. Rickin was a senior journalist, one of my senior reporters.\n\n\"He had a background, professional relationship with the victim in question. I didn't. I had never met her. I was in London.\n\n\"Furthermore, I knew that he knew that he could not name her, use her real name. Put all these factors together, it did not occur to me that this could be wrong.\n\n\"I trusted my reporter and the reason I sent him to Sheffield was to make sure he got it right.\"\n\nMr Ansari added that he regarded Mr Majithia as a \"loose cannon\" at times, but only because of a lack of co-ordination about what he was doing.\n\nAfter the live on-air news report was broadcast and named the victim on 6 February last year, Mr Ansari said Mr Majithia called him in a state of panic saying: \"I've got the name wrong, it wasn't a pseudonym, it was her real name.\"\n\nMr Ansari told the court the pair met in a pub in London later that evening, where Mr Ansari says he was shocked to realise that Mr Majithia had never reported from court before.\n\n\"I remember being somewhat shocked that he hadn't previously told me that,\" he told the court.\n\nMr Ansari described Mr Majithia as \"very badly shaken\" and \"in a really bad way\" when he returned to London.\n\nPreviously on Thursday - the first day of the trial - the court heard a witness statement from the woman who said she was \"panicking and crying\".\n\nShe said she had found the process of giving evidence in the sex abuse trial at Sheffield Crown Court difficult and added: \"To then have my name given out as a victim of rape on a BBC radio station was unbelievable and made me feel sick\".\n\nThe court also heard how Mr Majithia had sent Mr Ansari his script for approval at about 16:35 GMT, and it was broadcast live at 17:00.\n\nMr Majithia explained to the court how the woman gave evidence in court from behind a screen and he wrongly assumed that when her forename was used in court it was a pseudonym.\n\nThe reporter said that he had a number of previous dealings with the woman as he investigated the Rotherham abuse scandal and had become confused, thinking that the name he had always called her was her real one, when it was not.\n\nThe prosecution had said it accepted Mr Ansari did not know or suspect the victim's real name was in the script but said he had good reason to suspect the name that was used might be wrong because Mr Majithia was inexperienced.\n\nMr Ansari was charged with -

Theresa May was challenged over the leaked Oxford hospital memo at Prime Minister's Questions\n\nCancer care at an NHS specialist hospital is becoming \"unsustainable\" because of staff shortages, its boss has warned.\n\nA memo to Oxford's Churchill Hospital staff, which was leaked to The Times, said chemotherapy cycles could be cut.\n\nThe memo from head of chemotherapy Dr Andrew Weaver says patients face delays as nurse numbers were about 40% down.\n\nA hospital trust spokesman stressed no decisions had yet been made that may affect treatment.\n\nTheresa May was asked to apologise to cancer patients by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who challenged her over the memo at Prime Minister's Questions earlier.\n\nIn response, she said the hospital had \"made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment\".\n\nDr Weaver wrote the hospital did not have enough nurses trained to deal with medication at its day treatment unit.\n\n\"As a consequence we are having to delay chemotherapy patients' starting times to four weeks,\" he wrote.\n\nA memo to staff at Oxford's Churchill Hospital has been leaked\n\nAn Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman told the BBC starting times were usually within four weeks, but understood the memo to mean they may have to be pushed back to the \"furthest limits\" of this time frame.\n\nHe said the hospital had met the national cancer waiting time standard of starting chemotherapy within 31 days of a clinical decision having been made, despite increases in cancer patient numbers.\n\nBut the memo also suggested cutting back on treatment to alleviate symptoms from six cycles to four.\n\n\"I know that many of us will find it difficult to accept these changes but the bottom line is that the current situation with limited numbers of staff is unsustainable,\" Dr Weaver adds.\n\nThe thought of cancer treatment being delayed or withheld is shocking. But this is really a simple case of supply and demand.\n\nCancer cases are becoming more common - and the numbers of staff employed to care for these patients are not rising quickly enough to keep up.\n\nA recent Cancer Research UK report found that the non-surgical workforce had increased by 4% in the past three years. The problem is that cancer incidence has risen by 8% each year.\n\nMany staff who provided feedback cited staff shortages as a key problem with chemotherapy nurses saying some of the gaps have even had to be plugged by nurses not properly trained in providing the treatment.\n\nCancer services, just like A&E, are undoubtedly struggling to keep up.\n\nThe trust spokesman said: \"We have not made any decisions to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or to reduce the number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment which patients with cancer receive.\n\n\"The internal email from Dr Andrew Weaver sets out some of the challenges facing our chemotherapy service, with his ideas for how to tackle these issues, and invites constructive comments and alternative proposals from other cancer doctors and clinical staff.\n\n\"However, it does not represent a change to our formal policy for chemotherapy treatment.\n\n\"We would like to reassure our patients that no changes to chemotherapy treatment have been made or will be made before thorough consideration has been given to all possible options.\"\n\nHe said that, like the rest of the NHS, the trust faced an \"ongoing challenge to recruit nursing staff\" and as well as recruiting nurses from overseas it was looking at \"rapid access to chemotherapy education and training\" for new staff.\n\nChemotherapy cycles could be reduced from six cycles to four, the memo suggested\n\nDavid Bailey, who is receiving treatment at the hospital,", "disaster.\"\n\nAFC Wimbledon were playing in the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since they reformed in 2002, but this thoroughly deserved victory has created another piece of history that recalled the Crazy Gang spirit of Wimbledon's famous 1988 FA Cup final win over Liverpool.\n\nThe Dons are five points adrift at the foot of League One but belied their lowly league position by dominating West Ham for much of the game, particularly during the first half.\n\nTerell Thomas had an early opportunity, but blazed over when well placed inside the box before Mitchell Pinnock's header was saved by goalkeeper Adrian.\n\nBut just as West Ham thought they had weathered the AFC Wimbledon storm, the home side took the lead.\n\nAnthony Wordsworth's neat pass found Appiah and his effort from just outside the area deflected off Angelo Ogbonna and beyond a wrong-footed Adrian\n\nAFC Wimbledon continued to press and their positive attitude was rewarded again shortly before the break.\n\nWagstaff stole the ball off Obiang in midfield before driving forward and finishing low into the corner.\n\nYou could understand if the Dons had then looked to defend and keep what they had, but instead they continued to push forward and went further ahead seconds after the restart courtesy of Wagstaff's neat flick from Appiah's cross.\n\nEven when West Ham reduced the arrears to 3-2, AFC Wimbledon continued to push men forward and were rewarded when 19-year-old substitute Sibbick nodded home Wordsworth's teasing cross to seal the win.\n\nDylan Connolly - making his first AFC Wimbledon start since joining from Dundalk at the start of this month - symbolised their positive approach. The 23-year-old Irishman was a constant threat down the right flank and was deservedly given a standing ovation when he was substituted late on.\n\nManager Wally Downes, a former Wimbledon player in the 1980s, only returned to the club in December.\n\nHauling the club away from the foot of the table is likely to be his priority, but he now has the chance to create more FA Cup history 31 years after that famous afternoon at Wembley.\n\nSpeaking before the game, Pellegrini had urged his West Ham players to show a \"winning mentality\" to ensure they would not be the victim of a cup shock and named a strong starting line-up.\n\nMarko Arnautovic, who has just signed a new contract, was a notable absentee, but there were starts for the likes of Andy Carroll, Javier Hernandez and Mark Noble.\n\nHowever, the Hammers simply did not get going in the first half, failing to muster a shot on target.\n\nTheir only effort of note was a deflected Hernandez shot that clipped the outside of the post.\n\nAt the other end, Arthur Masuaku struggled to cope with AFC Wimbledon's attacks down the left while Obiang's error just before half-time allowed Wagstaff to score the home side's crucial second.\n\nPellegrini responded by making the triple substitution at the break, bringing on Perez, Anderson and Ryan Fredericks, only to see his side concede within a minute of the restart.\n\nThe Chilean looked exasperated on the touchline with his side seemingly out of answers, but they showed spirit to drag themselves back into the game thanks to two of Pellegrini's substitutes.\n\nFirst Perez was alert to drive the ball into the corner after Michail Antonio's shot had been saved by Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nAnderson then showed a touch of class to curl home a wonderful free-kick from just outside the area for his ninth goal of the season.\n\nBut the Hammers continued to look vulnerable at the back and they can have few complaints with the result, as they were eliminated by a League One side in the fourth round for a second successive year.\n\n'I could have changed all the players' - what they said\n\nAFC Wimbledon manager Wally Downes speaking to BT Sport: \"I don't know if it was a plan, winning was the plan, not the 4-2.\n\n\"What was important was that they got over Tuesday's performance [3-0 home defeat by Fleetwood]. It was a great game to blow the cobwebs away and they did.\n\n\"Football is random. There is a load of analysis we do, me included, but on any given day, any team can beat any other team and we have done it tonight.\n\n\"They are a passing team but with Andy Carroll in the side they have to go direct and they may have got caught between the two. We knew it was important to stop Mark Noble getting the ball.\"\n\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini speaking to the club's official website: \"I changed three players because I could only make three changes. I could have changed all the players. Unfortunately for us, they scored their third goal in the first or second minute of the second half, which made it very difficult.\n\n\"We talked before the game that this game happens a lot of time where the team in the lower division beats the team which is better because they play every ball as if it is their last ball of the game. We didn't have that attitude and when we could, we didn't try.\n\n\"The pace of the game, the way we fought for every ball and the way we made movements to receive the ball were disappointing. I changed three players because I could only make three changes. I could have changed all the players. Unfortunately for us, they scored their third goal in the first or second minute of the second half, which made it very difficult.\"\n\u2022 None AFC Wimbledon scored more than one goal in a single match in the FA Cup proper against a side from a higher division for the very first time in what was their 10th such contest since they reformed in 2002.\n\u2022 None It is also just the second time AFC Wimbledon have progressed from an FA Cup proper tie against a side from a higher division, and the first since they beat Scunthorpe United in a first-round replay in 2011-12.\n\u2022 None AFC Wimbledon's Scott Wagstaff scored his first-ever brace in professional football - he had scored just two goals in his last 44 appearances in all competitions before the win over West Ham.\n\u2022 None West Ham have been eliminated from the FA Cup by a League One side for a second consecutive campaign after Wigan beat them in 2018; it is the first time they have been knocked out of the competition by sides from a lower division in back-to-back tournaments since 1998-99 (Swansea City) and 1999-00 (Tranmere Rovers).\n\u2022 None West Ham have conceded four goals in a single FA Cup game against a side from the third tier or below for the first time since January 1936 when they lost 4-0 to Luton Town in a third-round replay.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

The severe conditions were powered by a \"bomb cyclone\".The scheme forms part of the government's new social mobility action plan\n\nThe government is to set up 35 \"English hubs\" across the country in an attempt to improve child literacy.\n\nThe hubs are among a raft of new measures announced by Education Secretary Justine Greening.\n\nA \u00a35.7m investment will aim to boost literacy skills in 469 schools, whilst a \u00a37.7m hopes to develop high quality teaching resources.\n\nThe schemes form part of the government's social mobility action plan, launched last month.\n\nThe hubs will be set up by a new Centre of Excellence for Literacy Teaching, with a focus on raising standards in schools,\n\nThey will be similar to the government's \"Maths Hubs\", launched in 2014, which are led by an outstanding school or college and bring together education professionals to develop and spread good practice.\n\nOther measures to improve literacy will include \"phonics roadshows\" - to promote and improve reading - and a fund for trialling language development at home in the north of England.\n\nMs Greening said: \"Our ambition is that no community will be left behind on education.\n\n\"Today's literacy investment will help make sure that not just most, but every child arrives at school with the vocabulary levels they need to learn.\n\n\"And our investment will mean that once they are at school, every child will get the best literacy teaching.\"The council sits in the United Nations' headquarters in New York\n\nThe United Nations rose from the ashes of World War II as an organisation of \"peace-loving\" states.\n\nIt aimed to spare succeeding generations from the scourge of armed conflict, and its Security Council - which met for the first time in 1946 - was specifically tasked with ensuring global peace and security.\n\nOnce widely criticised as a talking-shop, the council has had a more active role on the world stage in recent years, introducing sanctions regimes and authorising the use of force in conflicts.\n\nFive nations are permanently represented on the Security Council. They reflect the post-war power structure that held sway when the council was formed.\n\nMembers of this privileged group work alongside 10 non-permanent member countries. Each member - permanent or otherwise - holds the presidency of the council for a one-month period, on a rotating basis.\n\nThe non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms by members of the UN General Assembly, the body that represents all UN members.\n\nThe aim is to achieve a regional balance, with five Asian or African members, two Latin American members, one east European, and two members from western Europe or other regions making up the mix of non-permanent members.\n\nNations compete keenly for council membership, maybe because of the prestige attached, or the chance to raise an issue that is in the national interest. Some countries announce their candidacy many years in advance and actively canvass votes.\n\nDraft resolutions are drawn up by one or more members of the council and circulated privately to the others.\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres is a former prime minister of Portugal\n\nThe drafts can be negotiated or changed in a process called \"consultations\". If agreed to by all members, the resolution is formally proposed to the council.\n\nEach member has one vote. Decisions on what the council calls \"substantive\" issues need a majority of nine votes before they can be passed, including either votes or abstentions from all five permanent members.\n\nNot surprisingly, the question of whether an issue is substantive or not is itself the subject of lively debate.\n\nThus, each of the permanent members has the right of veto; if one of them votes against a resolution, it cannot be passed. But a resolution can be passed if a permanent member abstains from the vote.\n\nA general decline in the use of the veto, which followed the end of the Cold War, helped the council to become a more effective decision-maker.\n\nThe Security Council attaches great importance to preventing armed conflict in the first place, but once a dispute has flared, its first aim is to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\nIf a conflict persists, the Security Council may work towards a ceasefire and deploy peacekeepers. It can order UN nations to impose sanctions and, as a last resort, it may authorise military action against an aggressor.\n\nThe status quo of the permanent members had not changed since the council's first meeting in 1946, and the make-up of the Security Council has climbed up the UN agenda.\n\nChange faces numerous hurdles, but the likelihood of reform was seen as having been boosted by an announcement by President Barack Obama that the US has backed India's ambition to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\nIndia, Germany, Japan and Brazil - known as the G4 - and the African Union are among those who have long lobbied for coveted permanent-member status.\n\nA working group on reform set up under the UN General Assembly in 1993 had made little progress on the matter, with a lack of consensus over potential candidates.\n\nThe then Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned the lack of reform could weaken the council's standing in the world.\n\nThe Security Council came under strong pressure from US President George W Bush in the run-up to the 2003 US-led Iraq campaign. Mr Bush cited Baghdad's \"decade of defiance\" of Security Council resolutions. \"Will the UN serve the purpose of its founding... or will it be irrelevant,\" he asked in a speech to the General Assembly in September 2002.\n\nThe Iraqi crisis tested the Security Council's credibility and authority to the limit. Resolution 1441, passed by the council, demanded that Iraq disarm and cooperate with weapons inspectors. But some permanent members, including France and Russia, disagreed with the US-UK assertion that 1441 allowed military action.\n\nWith France proposing to veto a second resolution authorising action, the decision to go to war was made without Security Council approval. The failure of diplomacy was seen as a bad portent for the Security Council's future prospects.\n\nMore generally, the Security Council has been criticised for not taking forceful action until a catastrophe or conflict unfolds, even when this might have been predicted, as in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.\n\nMindful of this, and the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which was undertaken without council approval, leaders of all 15 member states met in 2000 to adopt measures that would give the organisation more teeth, including a review of peacekeeping operations.\n\nMore recently the Security Council has acted with greater decisiveness. It has imposed sanctions on North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programmes, and authorised a no-fly zone over Libya that", "Boris Nemtsov.\n\nBoris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015\n\nMr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls.\n\nI asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy.\n\n\"If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,\" he countered.\n\nI then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama.\n\nMr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a \"completely stupid kind of conversation\" and walked out of the interview.\n\nLater, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing \"fake news\" and calling me \"an utter cretin... a globalist swine\".\n\nSuch is the language of the new world order.\n\nA few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing \"fake news\".\n\nUnder Trumputinism, the echo between Russia and America is getting louder by the day.\n\nPanorama: The Kremlin Candidate?

But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,\" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul.\n\nHer case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries.\n\nIt has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced.\n\nNow sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope.\n\nShe says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for \"not having proper documents to stay\".\n\nTwo days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison.\n\nSharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison\n\nPakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave.\n\nSharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left.\n\n\"I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card.\"\n\nShe served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C.\n\n\"This was the hardest and worst incident in my life.\"\n\nRealising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused.\n\n\"I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough.\"\n\nHer husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there.\n\n\"If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in.\"\n\nThe \"Afghan Girl\" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed.\n\nFor years she was unaware of her celebrity.\n\n\"When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo.\"\n\n\"I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy.\"\n\nSharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul\n\nNone of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes.\n\nBut her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green.\n\nShe says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour.\n\nSharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979.\n\n\"There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done.\"\n\nHer mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar.\n\nShe was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago. Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter.\n\nSharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\"They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me. I thank them. May God treat them well.\"\n\nAfghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani received her at the presidential palace\n\nThe government has promised to support her financially and buy her a house in Kabul.\n\n\"I hope the government will fulfil all its promises,\" she told me.\n\nKot district is a stronghold of militants linked to the so-called Islamic State group, so she can't go home to her village. Her green-eyed brother and hundreds of others have fled the area, fearing IS brutality.\n\n\"We cannot even visit our village now because of insecurity and don't have a shelter in Jalalabad.

The London-listed company's shares plummeted when sanctions were announced last April and have not recovered.\n\nThe firm's chairman, Lord Barker of Battle said: \"This is the first time independent directors of a London listed Russian company, with the strong support of minority shareholders, have successfully removed control from a majority shareholder as a direct response to US sanctions policy.\"\n\nBut lawmakers across the political spectrum have said it is inappropriate to ease sanctions on companies tied to the oligarch while Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigates whether Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Moscow.\n\nMr Deripaska, 51, has been a recurring figure in the investigation and has ties to President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty in September 2018 to attempted witness tampering and conspiring against the United States.\n\nLast week Belarussian model Nastya Rybka was briefly detained by Russian police, having claimed to have evidence of Russian interference in the election campaign obtained from Mr Deripaska.\n\nMr Deripaska has denied the allegations and successfully sued her.\n\nPresident Trump denies collusion, and Moscow has denied seeking to influence the US election on Mr Trump's behalf, despite US intelligence agencies' finding that it did so.Facebook, which owns social media site Instagram, says the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell was a \"devastating event\".\n\nSteve Hatch told the BBC's Media Editor Amol Rajan that he was \"deeply upset\", after Molly's father said he believes Instagram is partly responsible for his daughter's death.\n\nMr Hatch said Instagram was constantly reviewing its polices regarding images about depression and suicide, but experts advised the company that allowing those topics could help people feel supported.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been affected by self-harm, eating disorders or emotional distress, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.Claudia wants to encourage others to consider donating\n\nClaudia Campanella, 31, works as a student support administrator at a UK university, and in her spare time she is a poo donor.\n\n\"Some of my friends think it is a bit weird or disgusting, but it doesn't worry me. It's very easy to donate and I just want to help with medical research. I'm glad to contribute.\"\n\nHer faeces, teeming with \"good\" bugs, will be put into the bowel of a sick patient to help their poorly gut get better.\n\nClaudia knows her donation is extremely useful - that is why she does it - but is her poo extra special?\n\nScientists believe some people's poo might contain an ideal mix of healing bacteria to fix gut diseases, making them super-donors.\n\nClaudia says she wanted to become a donor because she had read that vegans might make particularly good candidates.\n\nThere's no good evidence that vegan poo is better than any other human faeces, but experts are exploring what might make a stool \"super\".\n\nDr Justin O'Sullivan is a molecular biology expert at the University of Auckland and he has been investigating the concept of super poo donors.\n\nOur guts house millions of bugs that live inside us as a community. This diverse microbiome is unique to each us - no two are exactly the same.\n\nAlthough faecal transplantation is still a relatively new field of medicine, evidence from the studies that have been done hint that some donors make the best poo for the job.\n\nDr O'Sullivan says: \"We see transplants from super-donors achieve clinical remission rates of perhaps double the remaining average.\n\n\"Our hope is that if we can discover how this happens, then we can improve the success of faecal transplantation and even trial it for new microbiome-associated conditions like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and asthma.\"\n\nDr Jon Landy is a consultant gastroenterologist for West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust and helps to co-ordinate their faecal transplant unit.\n\nHe agrees with the idea of a super-donor, but says finding one could be tricky.\n\n\"We do not understand yet what makes a super-donor, or why,\" he said.\n\n\"We always make sure our donors are healthy and not carrying any disease, but we don't test all of their microbiome to see what that is like.\n\n\"These are the sorts of investigations that might need to be done.\"\n\nDr O'Sullivan's research, published in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, suggests having lots of different microorganisms in your poo might be the advantage.\n\nHe says a larger number of species in the donor's stool has been shown to be one of the most significant factors influencing faecal transplantation outcome. And patients who respond well to the transplants develop a more diverse microbiome too.\n\nBut studies suggest success could also depend on how good a match the donor is for the patient.\n\nAnd it might not only be which bacteria are present in the poo.\n\n\"Some cases of recurrent diarrheal infection have even been cured with transplants of filtered stool, that has had all the live bacteria filtered out but still contains DNA, viruses and other debris.\n\n\"These viruses could affect the survival and metabolic function of transplanted bacteria and other microbes,\" says Dr O'Sullivan.\n\nClostridium difficile can overwhelm the gut and make vulnerable patients very ill\n\nDr Julie McDonald, a microbiome expert at Imperial College London, has been studying how to boost the success rate of stool transplants.\n\nCurrently, most donations are used to treat a dangerous bowel condition caused by an infection called clostridium difficile.\n\nThis infection can take hold when a patient's own \"good\" bowel bugs have been wiped out by antibiotics. For the most vulnerable, it can be deadly.\n\nDr McDonald's work suggests poo transplants do a very specific job, replacing something lost in disease.\n\nShe found patients suffering from clostridium difficile infections had virtually undetectable levels of a short-chain fatty acid valerate produced by healthy gut microbial metabolism\n\nThe levels could only be restored with a successful faecal transplant.\n\n\"In our lab we are trying to figure out exactly how the transplants work and we are looking at whether we even move away from giving faeces itself.\"\n\nInstead of giving the patient an injection of faeces they would be given a treatment based on the faeces, which they might find less off-putting.\n\nThis might help get round the whole poo taboo that's associated with donating, she says.\n\nClaudia wants people to \"get over the mental barrier\" and think about becoming a donor.\n\n\"It's really very easy to donate. It's simple to do. If you are thinking about it, check if a hospital nearby has a service and get in touch with them.\n\n\"I collect my fresh sample at home in a container that my hospital provides. Then I drop it off to the hospital as I pass by it on my way to work. It's just a little bit of effort.\"\n\nClaudia's now thinking about becoming a blood donor too. \"I've not got round to that yet, but it's something I might do.\"\n\nAnybody wishing to donate to the FMT bank at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital should contact simon.goldenberg@gstt.nhs.uk\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: BBC Radio 5 live commentary from 08:30 GMT, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website", "ys the English game.\n\nGuardiola has not given Toure any guarantees about his future beyond the summer.\n\nThe Ivorian, who joined City in 2010, has become more important since Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan suffered a cruciate ligament injury against Watford on 14 December that is likely to rule him out for the rest of the season.\n\nMidfielders Oscar and John Mikel Obi left Chelsea to move to China earlier this month, while former Manchester United and Manchester City forward Carlos Tevez reportedly became the world's highest-paid player when he joined Shanghai Shenhua.\n\nChelsea striker Diego Costa, the Premier League's joint-top scorer with 14 goals, had been linked with a move to Tianjin Quanjian, who recently signed Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel for a salary of more than \u00a315m a year. But the club ended their interest after the Chinese Super League reduced the number of foreign footballers allowed to play.\n\nNew rules stipulate that Chinese clubs will be able to field a maximum of three foreign players per game when the new season starts in March.Tesco's recent spat with Unilever has highlighted fears of a new inflationary surge\n\nThe downward pressure on the pound since the UK's vote to leave the European Union is starting to lead to upward pressure on the prices of most things we buy.\n\nBrexit, as we have been told by the prime minister, means Brexit. But inflation also means inflation.\n\nThe pound has repeatedly lurched lower in value since the outcome of the June 2016 referendum. Against the dollar, it is now worth 20% less than it was before the vote, and that fall is unlikely to be reversed in a hurry.\n\nThe basic laws of economics dictate that this will translate into higher inflation: foreign firms exporting goods to the UK will continue to charge the same amount for them in euros, dollars or whatever, but they will cost more in sterling when the prices are converted.\n\nThat goes for finished goods, such as food and drink or clothing, but also for raw materials that are processed here, such as car parts. Global supply chains mean that more than 50% of the components in cars \"made in the UK\" are actually sourced from overseas.\n\nPetrol, too, is likely to go up in price, because oil is priced in dollars.\n\nShopping for clothes is likely to be more costly\n\nSo higher rates of inflation appear to be a foregone conclusion. The question is, how much higher? What will the consequences be? And will anyone gain from this, or are we all set to lose out?\n\nOne estimate of the extent of possible price rises has come from the former boss of Northern Foods, Lord Haskins, who told the BBC that he expected to see food price increases running at an annual rate of 5% by this time next year.\n\nHe was speaking in response to supermarket chain Tesco's recent spat with Unilever, which was trying to pass on its higher costs incurred because of sterling's weakness - though that dispute has since been resolved.\n\nThe cost of food is an important factor in calculating the overall inflation rate, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which is published on a monthly basis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nSome economists are predicting that the CPI could hit 3% by the end of 2017.\n\nIf overall inflation did climb to the level predicted by Lord Haskins, it could be nudging close to the highest rate in a decade. In recent years, there have been two peaks in CPI inflation, in September 2008 and September 2011. In both those months, it reached 5.2%.\n\nBy historical standards, however, that pales in comparison with the levels reached in the 1970s, when the UK experienced several years of double-digit inflation. The worst year was 1975, during which prices went up by an eye-watering 24.2%.\n\nWe are unlikely to return to those days. But of course, back then, the industrial climate was different, trade unions were stronger and large groups of workers were able to obtain pay rises to match, despite government attempts to impose wage restraint.\n\nNowadays, substantial pay rises are harder to come by, so a lower level of inflation can have a bigger effect on living standards.\n\nIf we have to spend more money on goods while our salaries fail to keep pace with rising prices, then we are all likely to suffer to some degree.\n\nIt will certainly make Bank of England governor Mark Carney's job harder, because the Bank has a 2% inflation target.\n\nIf it goes above that, it increases the likelihood that he will raise interest rates to combat it, thus making life harder for those who owe money, such as on mortgages.\n\nMr Carney has said that \"monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes in the economic outlook\" - meaning that the next move in interest rates could be up or down.\n\nHe has also spoken at length of the trade-off between price stability and other economic factors, meaning that the Bank will not necessarily rush to raise rates.\n\nBringing inflation back to target too rapidly could cause undesirable \"volatility in output and employment\", he says.\n\nBut at the same time, Mr Carney says \"there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated\".\n\nIf you have a student loan, the level of interest charged is linked to a slightly different measure of inflation, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), and is not subject to the Bank of England's decisions.\n\nBut in most cases, a prolonged period of inflation reduces the value of people's debts, making them easier to pay off.\n\nIf inflation were to stay at that 5.2% level for 12 years, your debt would, in effect, be worth only half as much in real terms, because you would still owe the same number of pounds, but each of those pounds would have declined in value.\n\nPensioners may have trouble making their money last\n\nThe outcome is similarly mixed for pensioners. In their favour, state pensions are guaranteed by what is known as the \"triple lock\". In other words, they rise each year by the inflation rate, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.\n\nHowever, private pensions are not similarly protected. And to make matters worse, retired people are likely to spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel, which are particularly affected by the pound's big devaluation.\n\nPensioners are also more likely to be living off income from savings, and savers are clobbered by high inflation. Just as inflation erodes the value of debts, it also reduces the spending power of money kept in bank accounts, because prices go up and your money doesn't, especially with the ultra-low interest rates paid by banks at the moment.\n\nSo there is no unalloyed benefit from higher inflation for anyone. But some will feel more pain than others, while borrowers will certainly benefit more than savers.Some of the archaeological treasures of prehistoric Britain have been featured in a new set of eight stamps.\n\nIssued by the Royal Mail, the stamps include illustrations of a headdress dug up in North Yorkshire and a bronze shield cover found in the River Thames.\n\nThe Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Orkney and the Avebury stone circles in Wiltshire also feature.\n\nThe stamps present a timeline from an ancient ritual of 11,000 years ago, to the Iron Age of around 300 BC.\n\nIllustrated by London-based artist Rebecca Strickson, the stamps have been designed as overlay drawings, showing how people lived at the sites or used the objects.\n\nFor each of the stamps, Royal Mail will provide a special postmark on all mail posted in a postbox close to the site or where the artefact was found.\n\nPhilip Parker, stamp strategy manager at the Royal Mail, said: \"The UK has an incredibly rich heritage of prehistoric sites and exceptional artefacts.\n\n\"These new stamps explore some of these treasures and give us a glimpse of everyday life in prehistoric Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from the culture of ancient ritual and music making to sophisticated metalworking and the building of huge hill forts.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Coverage: Live radio and text commentary of every Andy Murray match on BBC Radio, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app. Watch highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January.\n\nThe first round", "since the series started in 1986.\n\nAmanda Mealing plays Connie Beauchamp in Casualty, having previously played the character in the BBC's other hospital drama Holby City.\n\nClaudia Winkleman has co-hosted Strictly Come Dancing, with Tess Daly, since 2014 and also presents a Sunday night show on Radio 2.

What we learned from Donald Trump's Davos speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump has told global finance leaders he will always put the US first when it comes to trade, but \"that does not mean America alone\".\n\n\"The US is open for business,\" he said in his inaugural address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday.\n\nBut he continued to attack \"predatory\" trade practices, warning partners that the US would not tolerate unfair trade.\n\nMr Trump's election campaign centred on America First, aiming to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition.\n\nThis policy appeared to contradict the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalisation and co-operation.\n\nMr Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate, and said the US was more attractive than ever to foreign investment.\n\n\"I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,\" he said.\n\nTaking credit for the strong economy in the US, he urged foreign investors to \"bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America\".\n\nAs he was speaking, latest figures for US economic growth were released, showing a slowdown in growth from 3.2% to 2.6% in the final quarter of last year. This meant annual growth for 2017 was 2.3%, up from 1.5% in 2016 but below the president's 3% target.\n\n\"America First, not America alone.\" It was the key line of the speech, and a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here.\n\nThis is all about trade and the US approach.\n\nThe fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation.\n\nBut today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade.\n\nWhich may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines.\n\nThe US president demanded a reformed international trade system that was \"fair and reciprocal\" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including \"massive intellectual property theft\" and providing state aid to industry.\n\nMr Trump also said he preferred bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He said he would consider negotiating with TPP states collectively, if it was in America's interest.\n\nHe later tweeted that his speech had been well received.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

While a sore throat can be painful, there are other ways to control the symptoms including taking paracetamol and medicated lozenges.\"\n\nNICE and PHE also said doctors should use set criteria to judge how likely it is that people have sore throats caused by bacterial infections.\n\nThis works by checking people for scores across a range of symptoms, which include fever, pus on tonsils, severely inflamed tonsils and the absence of a cough.\n\nEngland's chief medical officer, Dame Prof Sally Davies, has previously warned of a \"post-antibiotic apocalypse\" where infections would become harder to treat and common medical procedures such as cancer treatments could become too risky.\n\nIn some cases people have died from bugs that are resistant to all antibiotics.\n\nIn October, PHE said patients had \"a part to play\" in stopping the rise of infections and that more of them should be told to go home and rest rather than be given antibiotics.\n\nIn some cases people have died from bugs that are resistant to all antibiotics\n\nProf Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive at NICE", "to see what's left after the war in Syria.The CyberFirst competition aims to get more girls to consider a career fighting online crime\n\nTeenage girls who spend a lot of time online and on social media could become the UK's spies of the future, Britain's intelligence agency hopes.\n\nGCHQ is launching a competition with the aim of encouraging more girls to think about a career in cyber security.\n\nGirls aged 13 to 15 will compete in tests that will also cover logic and coding, networking and cryptography.\n\nWomen currently only make up 10% of the global cyber workforce, the agency says.\n\nThe competition is part of a five-year National Cyber Security Strategy announced in November 2016, and will be overseen by the new National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\n\nWorking in teams of four, the girls will complete online tasks remotely on their school computers, with each stage being harder than the previous one.\n\nThe 10 groups with the highest scores will then be invited to the CyberFirst competition final in London to investigate a complex cyber threat.\n\nCyberFirst's winning team will be awarded \u00a31,000 worth of computer equipment for their school, as well as individual prizes.\n\nThe NCSC was set up to be the main body for cyber security at a national level.\n\nIt manages national cyber security incidents, carries out real-time threat analysis and provides advice.\n\nAn NCSC spokeswoman said: \"Women can, and do, make a huge difference in cyber security - this competition could inspire many more to take their first steps into this dynamic and rewarding career.\"\n\nGovernment Communications Headquarters director Robert Hannigan said: \"I work alongside some truly brilliant women who help protect the UK from all manner of online threats.\n\n\"The CyberFirst Girls competition allows teams of young women a glimpse of this exciting world and provides a great opportunity to use new skills.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Lewis Hamilton has backed Mercedes replacing Nico Rosberg with Valtteri Bottas, says team boss Toto Wolff.\n\nMercedes signed the Finn this week after agreeing a deal to buy him out of his Williams contract to replace Rosberg, who retired after winning last year's world title.\n\nWolff said: \"Lewis said he thought Valtteri was a nice guy.\n\n\"One of the guys he actually got along with well in Formula 1 and he felt he was a good option.\"\n\nWolff, who was talking to Finnish commentator Oskari Saari for a podcast, said he believed there might be less tension between Hamilton and the 27-year-old Finn than there was between the triple world champion and Rosberg.\n\n\"I think that works well,\" he added. \"It was OK already between Nico and Lewis, but there was the luggage of the past... Now it is a completely new relationship and there is no animosity.\n\n\"There will be moments where it is going to be difficult, but I think that how the personalities are for the team it's going to be a good situation and one that is maybe a bit easier to handle than the past. But I could be wrong.\"\n\nBBC Sport revealed on Monday that Bottas had signed a one-year contract, with options to extend it into subsequent seasons.\n\nWolff said that was because a number of leading drivers' contracts were up for renewal at the end of the 2017 season - including multiple world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and McLaren - and Mercedes wanted to keep their options open.\n\n\"We wouldn't have chosen Valtteri if we thought that he was not good enough to continue with the team,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"But, as a matter of fact, the market is very dynamic at the moment. Next year options open - young drivers, Sebastian, Fernando, Valtteri, many of them. So it is about understanding that - and Valtteri does.\n\n\"Equally we have great faith and confidence in him that he can stay with us for a long time, but now we need to see how the season goes.\"The day begins early for President-elect Trump at the exclusive White House guest residence.\n\nAnd from there it's a day of tradition and ceremony throughout Washington DC.China has launched a direct rail freight service to London, as part of its drive to develop trade and investment ties with Europe.\n\nLondon will become the 15th European city to join what the Chinese government calls the New Silk Route.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood.\n\n\"We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,\" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica.\n\n\"It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump\n\nThe presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind.\n\n\"The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries.\"\n\nSevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people.\n\nBar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager.

Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids.\"\n\nMateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out.\n\n\"She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that.

What are the questions waiting at the top of his in-tray? And what should he do differently to avoid the sudden exit of his predecessor?\n\n1) How to get back the political initiative?\n\nDamian Hinds will have to re-energise the Conservatives' vision for education, finding something positive that will connect with the public.\n\nFrom the perspective of 10 Downing Street, it must have seemed as though Labour was making much of the weather over schools and universities.\n\nParents were worried about being asked to bail out cash-starved schools. And Jeremy Corbyn's promise to scrap tuition fees had seen Labour's student vote reaching record levels.\n\nJustine Greening seemed unenthusiastic about the prime minister's Tory heartlands view of education, characterised by the push for more grammar schools.\n\nDamian Hinds will have to tackle questions of funding for schools\n\nBut, it is suggested, there was impatience in Downing Street about the lack of any clear alternative vision or policy offer for parents.\n\nThere is a catch for Mr Hinds. His revival has to cost nothing and not take up legislative time consumed by Brexit.\n\n2) Can anyone end the pain of tuition fees?\n\nTheresa May has promised a major review of university funding and how much students should be expected to pay - as evidence that she was \"listening\" after the election.\n\nJo Johnson, the outgoing Universities Minister, had made no secret of his reluctance for any significant changes. But his departure opens the way for a much more far-reaching review.\n\nThe issue of funding universities has caused pain to successive governments\n\nThe rising levels of fees, interest charges and student debt, have been like a recurrent political toothache, and Mr Hinds will be looking for an affordable way to neutralise the electoral pain.\n\nIt's been the mouse-trap hidden in the in-tray for ministers of successive governments.\n\nAnd he will have to see whether university bosses can really be more restrained over pay, after the chastening battles over \"fat cat\" salaries.\n\n3) What will head teachers be demanding?\n\nSchool funding gaps and teacher shortages are among the issues that heads see as most urgent.\n\nThey are exasperated that they have to keep juggling and struggling on with what they claim are inadequate budgets.\n\nHeads will tell ministers to focus on the basics of funding and staffing\n\nIn the election it became a significant doorstep issue, not least because head teachers discovered the power of sending a letter home to millions of parents.\n\nWhen it comes to plausibility, head teachers' warnings of cuts to children's lessons will always win out over politicians protesting that funding is at record levels.\n\nIt's a challenge that the new education secretary will have to resolve. Otherwise he risks cold water being poured over any other initiatives, as heads tell ministers to get back to the basics of funding and staffing.\n\n4) What does social mobility actually mean?\n\nDamian Hinds and Justine Greening have something in common. They both say social mobility is a priority, as has the prime minister.\n\nBut what does it really mean? The government's own social mobility commissioners walked out claiming so far it had been all talk and no progress.\n\nMr Hinds has previously highlighted the importance of investing in the early years, before the social divide begins to widen.\n\nJo Johnson's departure as Universities Minister could open the way for a bigger review of tuition fees\n\nHe has also pointed to the central importance of high-quality teachers to making sure that the disadvantaged get the best chances in school.\n\nIt might seem an age ago, but before the election the focus of social mobility was on the need to help \"ordinary working families\", working hard on low incomes and without access to good schools.\n\nMr Hinds will have to decide how to make social mobility something more than rhetoric and good intentions.\n\n5) How to balance tradition with reform?\n\nAs a former grammar school boy from the north-west of England, with a Hampshire constituency, Mr Hinds will be seen as representing a less metropolitan view of education.\n\nJustine Greening left Downing Street and the government on Monday night\n\nHe will be seen as closer to the views of Tory backbenchers, uncertain about the wholesale ditching of grammar schools.\n\nMr Hinds will also be expected to push through a change to free school regulations, promised in the Conservative manifesto, which would make it easier for faith groups to set up new schools.\n\nThis would allow religious free schools to give priority in admissions in the same way as existing local authority and academy faith schools.\n\nSuch a change, likely to increase the number of faith schools, will be opposed by humanists and secular campaigners.\n\nBut that could be the kind of opposition and clear blue water that would be relished by an education secretary wanting to assert his traditionalist credentials.\n\nMinisters have always been advised to pick their enemies as carefully as their friends - and Mr Hinds will also have noted that Ms Greening's bridge-building with the teachers' unions did her no political favours.\n\nAnd someone somewhere is going to write a headline about the benefit of \"Hinds-sight\".David Attenborough's underwater documentary series Blue Planet II was the most-watched TV show of 2017.\n\nThe 29 October episode - the first of the series - attracted more than 14 million viewers to BBC One.\n\nBlue Planet II occupied the top four slots in the end-of-year top 10.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing was the second most popular show, followed by I'm a Celebrity...

The new adverts from the Army are voiced by serving soldiers\n\nCritics have said an Army recruitment campaign, which promotes the emotional support given to troops, will fail to target those most likely to sign-up.\n\nNew radio, TV and online adverts seek to address concerns potential soldiers might have about religion or sexuality.\n\nRetired Colonel Richard Kemp said the new \u00a31.6m campaign would not solve the Army's \"recruiting crisis\".\n\nBut General Sir Nick Carter, head of the Army, said the campaign reflected the country's", "Agence France-Presse.\n\nOfficials have been working for months to recover debris from the flight\n\nIndonesia's Navy spokesman Agung Nugroho told Reuters that the recorder was found 8m deep, under mud on the sea floor.\n\nMr Nugroho said that a weak signal from the recorder had been detected \"for several days\".\n\nHe added that the recorder had \"obvious scratches on it\", but that it was unclear what damage it had suffered.\n\nHuman remains had also been found near where the voice recorder was discovered, said Mr Nugroho.\n\nWhen the flight data recorder was found in November, officials said that it could take up to six months to analyse data.\n\nThe plane's flight data recorder was recovered last November\n\nListening to the last conversations between the pilots and ground control on the CVR should help investigators finish piecing together what went wrong in the short flight.\n\nFlight JT610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday).\n\nIt crashed minutes after the pilot asked for permission to turn back to the airport.\n\nFindings by Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) suggest that Lion Air had put the plane back into service despite it having had problems on earlier flights.\n\nThe pilots appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature of the Boeing 737 Max.\n\nThe anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, the findings suggest.\n\nInvestigators have now said that the plane was not airworthy and should have been grounded.\n\nSome victims' families are suing Boeing over the accident.A group of lucky Cathay Pacific customers have scored first-class seats at economy prices, in the second fare blunder by the airline this month.\n\nTickets on trips from Hong Kong to Portugal were sold on the airline's website for $1,512, instead of $16,000 usually charged for a similar journey.\n\nThe carrier said it would honour the tickets as it investigates the cause of the error.\n\nIt extends a recent run of blows to the firm including a huge data breach.\n\nThe mispriced fares were available on Cathay Pacific's website on Sunday.\n\nFirst-class flights from Lisbon to Hong Kong - via London with a connecting flight - were offered for $1,512 (\u00a31,177), according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn a statement, the Hong Kong carrier said it would honour the tickets.\n\n\"We are looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors,\" it said.\n\n\"For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services.\"\n\nJust two weeks ago the airline made the same blunder.\n\nLucky flyers made off with business-class seats on flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. They should have cost $16,000.\n\nAt the time, the carrier acknowledged its \"mistake\" and again, said it would welcome the passengers onboard.\n\nAirlines have a mixed history of honouring tickets sold in error.\n\nSingapore Airlines, for example, honoured tickets sold for less than half price in 2014. But United Airlines cancelled transatlantic tickets sold for less than $100 by a \"third party software provider\" the following year.\n\nIn October, the firm was the subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers.\n\nA month earlier, it had to send one of its planes back to the paint shop after spelling the airline's name \"Cathay Paciic\" on the side of a jet.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based airline joked \"Oops this special livery won't last long\" after the error was pointed out\n\nThose missteps come as the airline tries to return to profitability after posting its first ever back-to-back annual loss in March.\n\nCathay Pacific has struggled against competition, particularly from low-cost Chinese carriers covering Hong Kong, mainland China and South East Asia.Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Daily live commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast daily from 07:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online from 19 January.\n\nAndy Murray produced a superb fightback in what might have been his final match but eventually lost in five sets to Roberto Bautista Agut in the Australian Open first round.\n\nThe Briton, who is hoping to play at Wimbledon, battled brilliantly before losing 6-4 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-7 (4-7) 6-2.\n\nMurray, 31, struggled early on but had the Melbourne Arena crowd roaring as he took the third and fourth sets.\n\n\"If this was my last match, it was an amazing way to end,\" he said.\n\n\"I gave everything I had - it wasn't enough tonight.\"\n\u2022 None Fireworks, fist-pumps and proof Murray has a Hollywood finish left in him\n\u2022 None 'Quality of life' is key as Murray ponders further hip surgery\n\u2022 None Did we all retire Murray too soon?\n\u2022 None 'I am not a ruthless animal like Murray'\n\nMurray, a three-time Grand Slam champion, said on Friday he would retire this year because of a chronic hip problem.\n\nHowever, he did suggest in his on-court interview that there was still a chance he could return to Melbourne.\n\n\"Maybe I'll see you again. I'll do everything possible to try,\" said an emotional Murray after an epic match which lasted four hours and nine minutes.\n\n\"If I want to go again, I'll need to have a big operation, which there's no guarantee I'll be able to come back from anyway, but I'll give it my best shot.\"\n\nFollowing Friday's news conference at Melbourne Park when Murray broke down in tears, many expected the Scot would struggle against a player he had beaten in their three previous meetings.\n\nThere were signs in the opening few games that the two-time Wimbledon champion could provide a tough contest. Having initially positioned himself nearer the back of the court, Murray moved further forward by the eighth game and earned a break point, which he could not convert.\n\nSpaniard Bautista Agut went on to break his opponent in the next game before taking the set.\n\nWatched on by brother Jamie and mother Judy, Murray's grimaces were growing in number. He was broken again in the fifth game of the second set as Bautista Agut produced a smash winner, and then served out for a two-set lead. The 22nd seed seemed on course for a routine victory.\n\nThose inside the arena must have believed they were about to witness one of Britain's greatest sportspeople play his final set of tennis at this tournament and, perhaps, his career.\n\nAfter the Spaniard broke to 15 in the third game of the third set, it seemed the inevitable was imminent.\n\nBut Murray's career has been built on his doggedness, durability and refusal to give in. To use an analogy from one of his favourite sports, the Briton beat the count and punched back by breaking in the next game with a superb backhand down the line.\n\nAnother stunning shot helped him save break point in the eighth game and he was close to taking the set in the ninth, only to strike a forehand into the net.\n\u2022 None Edmund out in first round but Evans wins\n\nBut the groans from many of the 10,000 spectators soon turned into euphoric cheers as Murray took the third set on a tie-break. The Scot shrieked with delight and clenched his fist in a manner we have grown accustomed to since he turned professional in 2005.\n\nBautista Agut was now playing against a rejuvenated Murray and a partisan crowd. Running on adrenaline, the Scot also took the fourth set on a tie-break.\n\nWas Murray about to deliver one of his greatest and most unexpected comebacks?\n\nHe was on top again during Bautista Agut's first service game of the decider, leading 0-30. But the Spaniard managed to get a second wind in the nick of time to hold before he broke Murray twice en route to sealing victory.\n\nIt remains", "the law and the start of the Open Banking system means people can allow businesses, other than their bank, to access their financial data.\n\nOrganisers say this has the potential for consumers to get better deals, such as cheaper overdrafts, and to speed up the switching process.\n\nBut warnings over fraud risks have already been issued.\n\nAs part of the same legislation, surcharges for payments made by credit card, debit card, or other payment systems such as PayPal will be banned.\n\nTraditionally, banks have held all our information about our past transactions and spending habits.\n\nA change in UK law now means that banks and building societies must allow regulated businesses access to a customer's financial data, but only if the customer has given their permission.\n\nThe bank can only block access if it suspects fraud or unauthorised access.\n\nThe UK's Open Banking system should ensure that such access is given by the UK's nine biggest current account providers in a secure way, and without the need for customers to reveal their online banking login details or passwords.\n\nThe main idea is that individuals can allow apps and online services to analyse their spending and find better deals on everything from loans and mortgages to shopping and broadband. Customers can give, and withdraw, permission at any time.\n\nImran Gulamhuseinwala, trustee of the organisation overseeing Open Banking, said: \"It is difficult to overstate just how revolutionary open banking could, and should, be. New products will emerge from incumbents and entirely new entrants will join the market.\"\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) told the UK's nine biggest current account providers to be ready to start Open Banking by 13 January. However, only four - Allied Irish Bank, Danske, Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide Building Society - will be fully ready to begin.\n\nA maximum of six extra weeks of preparation time has been given to Barclays, Bank of Ireland, RBS and HSBC by the CMA. Santander-owned Cater Allen, which offers business accounts, has been given an extra year.\n\nAnalysts and regulators expect consumer behaviour to change steadily over time.\n\nSurveys have suggested that most customers are reluctant to give out too much information about themselves.\n\nOnly firms which are regulated and registered on a directory will be allowed to take part in Open Banking. However, NatWest, one of the banks ordered to be ready for the new system, has warned that fraudsters could mimic these firms to trick people into giving them access to their accounts.\n\nSuch a fraud could leave consumers at risk of losing their money.\n\nNew financial service providers are also expected to be targeted by hackers, although they must prove their robustness to regulators.\n\nGareth Shaw, of consumer group Which?, said: \"Open banking has the potential to offer consumers more control of their finances and boost choice but it also comes with potential risks around data privacy and security.\n\n\"Regulators and industry must ensure that customers are properly protected from data breaches and scams, which is vital if consumers are to use these services with confidence and trust.\"\n\nIf a mistake is made by a regulated service using Open Banking, such as money going missing from an account, then a consumer should be compensated by their bank.

The amendment proposed by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve would require the government to come back within three days, rather than 21, to debate the implications of not having a Brexit deal - if the prime minister's deal is indeed voted down next Tuesday.\n\nUnder the previous rules, that debate would be kicked back to late February, with the Brexit clock ticking remorselessly in the background.\n\nThe new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a \"managed no-deal\" to a further referendum, via a \"Norway option\" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table.\n\nIf a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs.\n\nThis is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler.\n\nI don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit.\n\nThe decisions will come much faster, and potentially, those plotting an alternative course to the PM's would have more space in which to work.\n\nAnd it may also set a sweeping precedent allowing MPs far more grip over their debates, on Brexit and pretty much anything else.\n\nIf such a precedent can be made to stick, it would be a huge blow against any government's accustomed control over the business of the Commons.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThis is the biggest thing the Speaker has done, or is likely to do, easily eclipsing his decision to allow an extra amendment to the 2013 Queens' Speech, kicking off the Commons campaign which ultimately led to an EU Referendum becoming official Conservative policy.\n\nHe got through a testing hour of points of order - which represents a victory of sorts, because he wasn't toppled by angry MPs in the way Michael Martin was a decade ago. But there will be consequences.\n\nFor a start, a motion of no confidence in him now looks pretty certain. It may just languish in the \"Remaining Orders and Notices\" section of the Commons Order Paper, but it may take off and attract a critical mass of support from enraged Tories.\n\nBeyond that, the Speaker already has Conservatives openly accusing him of pro-Labour bias. Once unthinkable, that has now become a daily event, and may now become an hourly event.\n\nCriticism of other aspects of his running of Commons business (too many urgent questions, emergency debates and over-running PMQs) may become continual.\n\nThings are about to become very uncomfortable in the Chamber.\n\nAbove all there's the bullying inquiry and the allegations levelled against the Speaker himself, which have been repeatedly denied, that he has bullied colleagues.\n\nThis is an inquiry that should not be postponed to protect the Speaker, nor weaponised to destroy him; but it could well be.\n\nI suspect that, one way or another, Mr Bercow's turbulent tenure in the Commons chair is coming to an end.\n\nPerhaps in months rather than weeks, but not before the big Brexit votes (and it's not impossible that somewhere along the way, he might have to make this kind of ruling again).\n\nThe basic question his would-be successors will have to answer is how much of the Bercow revolution in the way the Commons works should be scrapped - and how much should be retained?Ashley Judd can still proceed with her claim that Harvey Weinstein tried to sabotage her career\n\nA sexual harassment claim brought by actress Ashley Judd against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been dismissed by a court in California.\n\nBut the judge said she could still pursue a defamation claim that Mr Weinstein sabotaged her career.\n\nMr Weinstein has been accused by more than 75 women of varying degrees of sexual misconduct going back decades - allegations he denies.\n\nHe has been charged with five counts of sexual abuse, including rape.\n\nThe disgraced producer - who denies the charges, which were brought by two women - will stand trial in New York later this year.\n\nAshley Judd was one of Mr Weinstein's original accusers. Her sexual harassment lawsuit was re-filed following a change in California state law after her initial claim was rejected by Judge Gutierrez in a Los Angeles federal court last September.\n\nShe alleges she rejected unwanted advances from him and he then tried to wreck her career.\n\nBut in a statement late on Wednesday, Judge Gutierrez said the law that deals with sexual misconduct claims in professional relationships, which was revised to include directors and producers, could not be applied retrospectively to Ms Judd's case.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein\n\nHowever, Ms Judd's claim that the Oscar-winning producer \"blackballed\" her after she refused his advances would still be heard, Judge Gutierrez said.\n\nThat part of her lawsuit states that \"Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work\".\n\nIn 2017, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was \"blacklisted\" following conversations with the Weinstein Company.\n\nHe said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a \"nightmare\" to work with.\n\nMr Weinstein, however, said he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career.\n\nMs Judd's lawyer Theodore Boutrous said of Wednesday's court ruling that it would not prevent her \"moving forward on multiple claims\".\n\n\"While we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision as to the one claim it ruled on today, we look forward to pursuing the three claims for relief that the Court has already ruled can move forward,\" he added.\n\nMr Weinstein's lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, welcomed the judge's decision. \"We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did,\" she said in a statement, adding: \"We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her [Ms Judd's] remaining claims.\"A prolific smuggler caught entering the UK with protected birds' eggs strapped to his chest has been jailed for three years and one month.\n\nJeffrey Lendrum, 56, of Cliftonville Road, Northampton, was stopped at Heathrow Airport in June last year after arriving from South Africa.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to four offences on the second day of his trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.\n\nThe court heard Lendrum has a long history of egg smuggling.\n\nOn 26 June, he arrived in London from Johannesburg carrying eggs from endangered birds of prey, including vultures, eagles, hawks and kites, worth up to \u00a3100,000, the Telegraph reported.\n\nLendrum had strapped the illicit cargo to his body in a sling underneath a heavy coat, the court was told.\n\nLendrum has been described as a \"wildlife criminal\"\n\nThe prosecution was able to prove that Lendrum knowingly smuggled the eggs for commercial gain by trying to evade customs, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.\n\nLendrum was jailed for 18 months in 2010 after he was caught at Birmingham Airport with egg boxes strapped to his chest.\n\nHe had taken 14 eggs from peregrine falcon nests in south Wales and tried to smuggle them out of the UK.\n\nPolice described him at the time as \"the highest level of wildlife criminal\".\n\nIn", "9 and went on to establish the Anah\u00ed Foundation, named after her granddaughter, that helps co-ordinate organ donation and transplants.\n\nShe also opened a museum in the building in which Diana Teruggi was killed, and from where Clara was taken. Its walls remained riddled with bullet holes from the day of the raid in 1976.\n\nAll the time, however, Mariani had a theory about what may have happened to her granddaughter. In late 1983, she saw a photograph of a girl in a newspaper and immediately thought she recognised her.\n\nThe girl, Marcela Noble Herrera, was the daughter of the head of the Clar\u00edn group, Argentina's biggest media company, that had been allied to the military junta. Marcela, along with her brother Felipe, had been adopted in 1976.\n\n\"I saw the photos of her in England, France, with presidents and kings, and with the Pope,\" Chicha Mariani told the New Yorker in 2012. \"I watched her grow. She has the same body as my daughter-in-law's mother. And her character seems similar to ours - reserved, modest, sincere, sensitive, and very intelligent.\"\n\nAfter a long legal battle that dominated headlines in Argentina, Felipe and Marcela Noble Herrera agreed to be tested in 2011. Those tests showed there was no genetic link to Chicha Mariani nor to dozens of other relatives of the disappeared.\n\nThere was little progress in the search for Clara Anah\u00ed in the following years - until a surprise announcement on Christmas Eve 2015.\n\n\"After 39 years of tireless searching,\" a statement by the Anah\u00ed Foundation said, Chicha Mariani and her granddaughter had been reunited. DNA tests had established a 99.9% chance that Mariani and a woman from the central C\u00f3rdoba province were related, and they were seen smiling and hugging in photographs.\n\nThe result, Mariani's foundation said at the time, \"fulfills one of the greatest wishes of Argentine society\" and President Mauricio Macri tweeted out his congratulations.\n\nThe reunion was reported around the world at Christmas in 2015\n\nTwo days later, the story began to unravel. It emerged that the tests had been conducted in a private laboratory, and not through the official channels that Mariani and the Abuelas had helped establish.\n\nFurther tests revealed no match between the two women. Mariani, who was 91 and almost blind, said she was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\nInvestigators said the woman who had visited Mariani had learned she was not a match several months earlier. Mariani said she believed this had been an attempt to undermine the work of the Abuelas.\n\nThe groups continues to encourage Argentines who question their origins to undertake DNA testing. To date, they have succeeded in identifying 126 grandchildren who had disappeared.\n\nUp to her death, Chicha Mariani had held out hope for her own reunion, and would often tell interviewers: \"I can't afford to die - I have to find my granddaughter.\"\n\nIn a tribute to their co-founder, the Abuelas said they would keep searching for Clara Anah\u00ed on her behalf.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Last updated on .From the section Man Utd\n\nFormer Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has returned to the club's training ground for the first time since suffering a brain haemorrhage.\n\nFerguson, 77, met former striker and current caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Carrington on Saturday.\n\nThe Scot did not attend any training sessions during David Moyes and Louis van Gaal's managerial reigns, but was invited back by Jose Mourinho.\n\n\"He enjoyed his time at the training ground,\" said Solskjaer.\n\n\"He had a few nice chats with the staff and he encouraged us.\"\n\nUnited have won all three Premier League games since Solskjaer, 45, was appointed until the end of the season following Mourinho's sacking on 18 December.\n\nMike Phelan, Ferguson's former assistant, has returned to the backroom team, while Michael Carrick, a player Ferguson signed in 2006, remains on the coaching staff.\n\nFerguson signed Solskjaer from Molde in 1996 and made the Norwegian reserve-team boss after he retired as a player in 2007.\n\nSolskjaer, who won the Champions League, six Premier League titles and two FA Cups at United, said: \"I had him for 15 years.

All my PE teachers like it that I've got a prosthetic leg and that I'm still doing sport. They say I have a lot of grit and zest!\"\n\nHe was fitted with his new blade just before Christmas and switches between that and his other prosthetic leg depending on what he is doing.\n\nBen says his blade means he can now compete on the sportsfield\n\n\"Ben has been empowered by his blade,\" says Clare. \"We hope it will give him a level playing field so he can compete with his peers and participate in more sports with a lighter prosthetic.\"\n\nClare adds that although she was able to make an attachment for Ben's disordered right leg as he was growing up, it was not possible to include the sort of components that could give him a spring in his step.\n\nAfter three weeks practising with the blade, Ben returned to Clare's treatment room at Brighton General Hospital and tried jogging, running and playing indoor tennis.\n\nHe has also just taken on his able-bodied cousin in a straight race and won.\n\n\"The blade feels good,\" says Ben. \"The spring of it is the bit that makes me go faster.\"\n\n\"I wanted the blade to do more running, so I didn't have to stick with cricket and stuff like that to do with upper body.

Alarming for the fans and for the manager. It was embarrassing,\" Shearer added.\n\nThe Hammers have struggled for consistency in front of goal this season, scoring just 23 times in their 20 Premier League matches - four of which were netted against Swansea on Boxing Day.\n\nRegular injuries to Andy Carroll, Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew have not helped matters, nor has on-loan Juventus forward Simone Zaza's inability to find his feet - or the net - in England.\n\nNo wonder they have targeted an attacker in this transfer window, already having bids turned down for Sunderland's Jermain Defoe and Hull City's Robert Snodgrass.\n\nThis was another toothless performance.

How do UK rail fares compare to Europe?\n\nFare increases to regulated fares - which comprise about half of all tickets - are calculated using the previous July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation.\n\nSince 2007 the financial burden of running the rail system has increasingly fallen on passengers, after the government decided taxpayers as a whole should pay less via subsidies.\n\nConservative MP Martin Vickers, a member of Parliament's transport select committee, sympathised with season ticket holders, but told Radio 4's World at One programme that it is appropriate for rail passengers to make their contribution to the system.\n\n\"The reality is that someone has to pay and it's either the tax payer or the users of the system,\" he said.\n\nHe said the system of privatisation is \"far from perfect\" but added that it was the failings of Network Rail - which is nationalised - that is leading to the system's \"lack of capacity\".\n\nCampaigners have planned protests at busy rail stations, including Kings Cross in London\n\nFares used to account for about half the cost of running our trains, whereas now it is about 70%.\n\nPaul Plummer, chief executive of industry trade body the Rail Delivery Group, said fare changes would provide cash for better services and investment, including the Thameslink and Great Northern rail upgrades.\n\nSpeaking from London Bridge station, where five revamped platforms have been opened, he said fares were \"underpinning massively required investment\".\n\nBruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, says the lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation measure should be used for regulated fare increases.\n\nHe argued that if CPI had been used rather than RPI since 2004, rail fares would be 17% lower.\n\nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling is out of the country for a ministerial visit to Qatar, but a government spokesman said the way fares were calculated was \"under review\".\n\nThe spokesman said the government \"carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change\".\n\nLabour's Mr McDonald said his plans to join protests across the country were \"interrupted\" after his train to Leeds broke down.\n\nHe tweeted a video message on board, saying: \"Let's take our railway back into public ownership.\"\n\nPassenger Sarah Beer, from Lingfield in Surrey, pays nearly \u00a34,000 a year for her rail commute to London, which she describes as an \"extortionate amount of money\".\n\n\"It is like watching the Great Train Robbery all over again,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"What I cannot grasp, in this day and age, is that all we ask for is a reliable train service.\"\n\nRobin Keenan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, said he has been priced out of his London-based job due to ticket costs.\n\n\"I'm starting a new job tomorrow that's a lot closer to home - so no more trains,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I've taken a \u00a32,000 hit in my wages but I'll be saving that amount due to a short bike journey.\"\n\nMany commuters expressed their frustration with the increases on social media.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

How the public reacted to a driverless pod in Milton Keynes\n\nCars that can do just that are already being tested on the roads in Chinese cities, says Prof Cassandras.\n\nSome cities, such as Stockholm, charge cars higher rates to travel at peak times in an effort to ease the rush hour.\n\nIn Copenhagen, half of all city residents get to and from work or school via bike, helping with the city's goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025.\n\nTraffic jams have fascinated scientists for decades, and there is even a branch of maths - jamology - devoted to their study.\n\n\"We humans are terrible drivers, and we cannot keep our speed constant,\" Prof Cassandras says.\n\nIn Lyon, you can take a ride on a driverless bus\n\nThat problem could be eliminated with the advent of automated cars - and with most of the big manufacturers promising to have fleets on the road by 2020 or soon after, that is a looming reality.\n\nBut a University of Michigan study suggests 23% of Americans would not consider riding in a driverless cars, while 36% would be so anxious they would constantly watch the wheel.\n\nIn response, companies are making vehicles that look friendlier.\n\nSemcon has a self-drive car that interacts with pedestrians by displaying a graphic that makes it look as if it is smiling, while cities such as Lyon are experimenting with cute-looking self-drive buses.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Uber has launched a fleet of self-drive taxis.\n\nAnd in Washington, Las Vegas and Florida, there are plans to run a 12-seat driverless bus fitted with IBM's artificial intelligence platform, Watson, so it can respond to conversational questions about journey times and even recommend local restaurants or historical sites.\n\nSo far it has had some limited trials.\n\n\"When people climb onboard and start interacting with Watson, they sure do crack a smile,\" says Matthew Lesh, head of mobility at manufacturer Local Motors.\n\nThere are several companies developing concept high-speed trains, including Hyperloop Technologies\n\nCities are at a crossroads when it comes to easing congestion - should they invest in expensive, hi-tech infrastructure schemes, such as China's straddling bus, or sit back and wait for the era of driverless cars to solve the problem?\n\nNo future transport system has captured the imagination or the headlines as much as the Hyperloop, conceived by Silicon Valley maverick Elon Musk as a super-fast transportation system consisting of low pressure tubes inside capsules.\n\nBut, increasingly, experts are questioning whether we need such grand futuristic schemes - and their objections are not about whether they are technologically feasible or even about the cost.\n\nHead of MIT's Senseable Cities lab Carlo Ratti asks: \"Do we really need a short trip in a small, dark tube?\"\n\nOn a recent trip from London to Paris, he opted for a slower journey and did not regret one moment of it.\n\n'I enjoyed very much spending two hours on the Eurostar,\" he says.\n\n\"I was online, the comfortable seat became my workplace during the trip, and I could enjoy the gorgeous English and French landscape all around.\n\n\"I thought that I had the most beautiful office in the entire world.\"\n\nBoston is often cited as a city that has got citizen engagement right, thanks to the mayor's Office of Urban Mechanics\n\nPotholes are the scourge of drivers and councils alike -

police cars, buses - which are just as likely to be found in poorer neighbourhoods,\" he says.The new museum will be built in LA's Exposition Park\n\nStar Wars' creator George Lucas will build his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles.\n\nThe project's organisers announced that after \"extensive due diligence and deliberation\" the city had been chosen over San Francisco.\n\nThe museum will cost over $1bn (\u00a30.8bn) and be financed by Lucas himself.\n\nIt will exhibit art and memorabilia from the Star Wars franchise and other cinema classics, including The Wizard of Oz and Casablanca.\n\nThe museum will be located in Exposition Park, near other attractions including the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the California African American Museum and the California Science Center.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said his city was \"the ideal place for making sure that it touches the widest possible audience\".\n\n\"We went after it with everything we have,\" he added.\n\nLucas, 72, has amassed a collection of over 40,000 items\n\nOriginally, Lucas had planned to build the museum in Chicago, but he faced local community opposition and abandoned the proposal last year.\n\nSan Francisco had offered a site on Treasure Island, in the middle of San Francisco Bay, but failed to win over the project's organisers.\n\nThe new museum will sit near the University of Southern California, where George Lucas studied film in the 1970s.\n\nAs well as Star Wars items like Darth Vader's mask, the museum will show artworks chosen from the 40,000 items in Lucas' collection, including works by such artists as Norman Rockwell, Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nLucas made the first Star Wars film in 1977 and sold the franchise to Walt Disney in 2012 for $4bn.Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nSouthampton hold a slender advantage in the EFL Cup semi-final after a fully deserved first-leg victory over Liverpool at St Mary's.\n\nNathan Redmond's cool finish from Jay Rodriguez's pass gave Saints a crucial lead to take to Anfield on 25 January -

Jeane Freeman: \"I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say for both families our thoughts and sympathies go to them.\"\n\nAn infection linked to pigeon droppings was a \"contributing factor\" in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital, it has been confirmed.\n\nScotland's health secretary ordered a review of the design of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after the deaths of two patients.\n\nThe hospital has put infection control measures in place, and officials insist it is safe for patients and visitors.\n\nJeane Freeman said there was an \"absolute focus on patient safety\".\n\nAt the weekend, it emerged that two patients who had died at the hospital had contracted a cryptococcal fungal infection which is linked to pigeon droppings.\n\nMs Freeman said one of the patients was elderly and had died from an unrelated cause, but that the infection had been a \"contributing factor\" in the death of a child.\n\nThe likely source of the infection has been traced to a 12th floor room containing machinery, which is not open to the public. Ms Freeman said traces of excrement had been found in the room, where there was a small break in the wall which was \"invisible to the naked eye\".\n\nThe health secretary spoke to the chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and senior clinical staff to seek reassurance for patients at the hospital.\n\nShe told MSPs: \"In November, the bacteria cryptococcus was identified in one patient. That patient was discharged for palliative care and sadly subsequently died in late December - but cryptococcus was not a contributing factor in their death.\n\n\"In December, a post mortem of a child who had passed away confirmed that cryptococcus was both present and contributing factor in their death.\n\n\"I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say to both families that our thoughts and sympathies go to them.\"\n\nMs Freeman also revealed in her Holyrood statement that the hospital was also investigating a separate, \"totally unconnected\" infection, after two patients tested positive for a different fungal organism.\n\nA water leak has been identified as the \"likely source\", but the health board said \"other investigations continue\".\n\nNHSGGC said an investigation is under way and a control measures have been put in place\n\nThe identification of two cases acted as the trigger for additional infection control measures at the hospital, including antifungal treatment for potentially vulnerable patients.\n\nThe health secretary said NHSGGC had kept patients and their families updated on an ongoing basis and would ensure they had the opportunity to discuss concerns with the senior clinical team.\n\nPortable HEPA air filter units have been installed in specific areas as an additional precaution. There have been no further cases reported.\n\nMs Freeman said a review of the hospital's design and construction would take into account \"a number of issues\" from recent years.\n\nShe said: \"There are two strands to this. The first is to deal with the current infection, which the board has done thoroughly, they've taken all the measures they should take.\n\n\"The other is the building itself. We need to be absolutely sure about the current state of this infrastructure - what do we need to fix, how has that arisen, and what are the lessons for our build elsewhere in the health service.\n\n\"That may be in aspects of the design that we weren't aware of at the time, it might be in aspects of the commissioning, it might be maintenance, or maybe a combination of all of those.\n\n\"That work has already been scoped out, and towards the end of this week I will agree with the board what external independent advice they will bring in to ensure that work is taken forward and that I'm assured that we do that as thoroughly and quickly as we possibly can.\"\n\nMultiplex, the building firm which worked on the design and construction of the hospital, said it had not been contacted about the review but \"will of course assist with the Queen Elizabeth project team if we are requested to do so\".\n\nJason Leitch from NHS Scotland insisted that \"this hospital is safe\"\n\nProf Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director for healthcare quality and strategy, said he was \"assured that this hospital is safe today\".\n\nHe said: \"That doesn't mean there aren't issues around the building that need reviewed and looked into, both for this building and to learn for Scotland.\n\n\"But I can assure the families who are coming in tomorrow for chemotherapy or coming in this week for bone marrow transplants, that this hospital is safe.\"\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells, who represents Glasgow, said this was \"simply not the kind of scenario that should be unfolding in Scotland in the 21st century, and absolutely not at such an expensive and newly-built facility\".\n\nAnd Labour's Monica Lennon said there had been a \"laundry list of problem which should have set alarm bells ringing at any hospital, never mind Scotland's flagship hospital\".\n\nOn Sunday, former health secretary Alex Neil called for an inquiry into the deaths as it emerged concerns were raised in December.\n\nMr Neil told BBC Scotland: \"I think there has to be an outside inquiry by experts to find why this happened in the first place, secondly how it has been handled by the health board and, thirdly, what precautions need to be taken for the future.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Kaiden Williams has a skin condition called vitiligo, but that has not stopped him landing a modelling contract with Primark.\n\nThe 13-year-old from Wolverhampton recently featured in a campaign for the clothes store and has been inundated with messages from others with the condition, who say they have been inspired by him.\n\nWhen Kaiden was younger, he used to cover up his patches.Police found the three bodies in a house in Arthur Street, Little Lever\n\nA mother in her 20s and her two young daughters have been found dead at a house in Bolton.\n\nPolice found the bodies of Tiffany Stevens and Casey, aged three, and one-year-old Darcey, at Arthur Street in Little Lever at 15:50 GMT on Monday.\n\nGreater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was an \"incredibly tragic incident\", but it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\n\nShe added: \"They", "not confirm the number of employees affected by the move but said it was \"in the thousands\".\n\nOn Monday, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, announced it was cutting 1,700 shop floor management jobs.\n\nLike the other major grocers, Sainsbury's is trying to cut costs and simplify its plans to save \u00a3500m over the next three years.\n\nEarlier this month, it confirmed it was \"on track\" to achieve \u00a3185m of cost savings this year, putting it ahead of target.\n\nSainsbury's, which jostles for position as the UK's second-biggest supermarket with Asda, has more than 1,400 stores in the UK.\n\nThe posts will be replaced by fewer, but mostly better paid, new management roles in each store.\n\nEmployees have the choice of either applying for these new roles or accepting a more junior position if unsuccessful. Otherwise they face redundancy.\n\nSimon Roberts, retail and operations director of Sainsbury's, said: \"We're proposing a store management structure that will deliver best in class leadership and, in many cases, will offer an improved reward package for new management roles.\n\n\"The proposals will introduce a more efficient and effective structure, designed to meet the challenges of today's retail environment. They will deliver cost savings to be invested in our customer offer and in our colleagues as they continue to provide the very best service for our customers.\n\n\"Our intention is not to reduce overall headcount as a result of these proposals.\n\n\"I appreciate this will be a difficult time for those affected and we will fully support our people through these changes.\"\n\nRival Tesco has said it intends to cut 1,700 jobs from its branches and warehouses as part of its turnaround strategy. However, it also plans to create 900 jobs and said it would try to move staff affected by the cuts into the new roles.\n\nTesco's UK chief executive Matt Davies said the changes were \"necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and set up for the future\".\n\nTesco is aiming to make \u00a31.5bn in cost savings over the three years to 2020.\n\nPhilip Dorrell, managing partner at Retail Remedy, said the \"ongoing stresses\" in the retail sector had been driven by a need to reduce costs in the face of shrinking profit margins.\n\n\"They are shrinking as the discounters have fuelled a need to be more competitive on price, at a time when the volumes that the retailers are selling reduce,\" he added.\n\nDiscount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl were picking up much of the business lost by the mainstream supermarkets, he added.\n\nAs a result, grocers have had to cut costs - and labour is one of their biggest costs. \"Therefore, the stage is set and the decline of the grocers' workforce will continue,\" he said.\n\nThe Unite union, which represents more than 12,000 members working for Sainsbury's, said the jobs to be scrapped included team leader/store supervisor roles in all branches. There would also be \"major changes\" to the department manager and deputy manager structure, it added.\n\nThe union said it would seek \"guarantees\" that there would be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the restructuring.\n\n\"We appreciate that Sainsbury's has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure the continuing employment for our members,\" said Unite's Bev Clarkson.The Admiral insurance group says it has taken the unprecedented step of contacting its customers to deny a newspaper report which suggests it is racist.\n\nThe Sun claims motorists using Admiral brands and M&S are being asked to pay more to insure their cars if their name is Mohammed, compared to the name John.\n\nBoth firms said they do not discriminate under any circumstances.\n\nA spokesman for The Sun said \"we stand by our story\".\n\nThe newspaper claimed it used \"identical details\" apart from names using 60 quotes from the price comparison website Go Compare, as well as quotes directly from the insurance companies and other comparison sites.\n\nBut a spokesman for the Admiral group, which has offices in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, said: \"The insurance quotes in the news article were not like for like.\n\n\"We take these allegations very seriously and we are consulting our lawyers.\"\n\nAdmiral has its headquarters in Cardiff, as well as offices in Swansea and Newport\n\nIn an email to customers, Admiral's chief executive for UK Car Insurance, Cristina Nestares, said: \"You may have seen a story in the news which claims we use customers' names to price our insurance based on race.\n\n\"This is 100% not the case and we do not, and have never, used this information to provide a price to our customers. I'm sorry if this story has caused you any concerns.\"\n\nShe added they used a \"complex rating structure\" to offer insurance prices using different variables and data sources.\n\n\"The journalists have misunderstood our pricing structure and the insurance quotes in the story are not like for like,\" she said.\n\nThe Sun article named the Admiral Group brands Admiral, Bell, Elephant and Diamond as well as M&S car insurance.\n\nThe newspaper alleged the companies \"always quoted more if the driver was called Mohammed\" and the difference was often hundreds of pounds.\n\nAn M&S Bank spokesman said they do \"not discriminate under any circumstances\" and a customer's name or ethnicity has \"absolutely no impact on their insurance premium\".\n\n\"We provided identical quotes in all cases where the scenarios for the two customers were exactly the same. Where there were differences in the scenario, there was a variance in price, this wasn't a result of the customer's name,\" he added.\n\nA spokesman from GoCompare said they had \"no influence\" over how customer information was interpreted by insurers in order to calculate insurance premiums.\n\n\"We collect the information from the customer and then present the prices and cover levels from insurers who are willing to quote for that customer,\" he said.John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them\n\nA new sexual assault allegation made against rapist John Worboys is being investigated by Scotland Yard.\n\nThe claim, which dates back to 1997, several years earlier than the date when it was thought Worboys' offending started, was reported to police this month.\n\nBBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Worboys could remain in custody if the investigation progressed quickly and led to criminal charges.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\nWorboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers.\n\nNews that the Parole Board had decided to free Worboys after a decade behind bars was met with a furore by Worboys' victims and in Parliament.\n\nLawyers representing victims said their clients were \"extremely distressed\" and, along with the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, demanded the government launch a judicial review of the decision.\n\nLast week, Justice Secretary David Gauke told the Commons the government would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Lawyers for two victims have said they intend to pursue the case in the courts.\n\nThis is a potentially significant development which could delay or even prevent John Worboys' impending release from prison. Although the investigation is in its early stages, and Worboys has not been arrested or interviewed, I understand that detectives are taking the allegation extremely seriously.\n\nIt was apparently not reported to police before and was not among the dozens of claims of sexual assault considered by police and prosecutors before and immediately after his trial in 2009.\n\nThat means it would be possible for the 60-year-old to face charges over it, should there be sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. If Scotland Yard and the CPS moved quickly the prosecution could start while Worboys is still in prison.\n\nThat would almost certainly mean he'd have to stay there at least until the trial - to the relief of his victims and the government.\n\nIt is understood Worboys' release is not imminent, but the former London black-cab driver was transferred from high-security prison HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London at the weekend - prompting fresh outrage that he may be allowed to return to the capital.\n\nDuring justice questions in the Commons earlier, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park", "uawei's chief executive (for the consumer side of things), gave a simpler explanation.\n\n\"Amazon Alexa is the best in this country,\u201d he told me.\n\n\"We want to bring to the consumer the best services. In the China market we have our own - we have no intention to do this [in the US] in the short term.\"\n\nLast year, Huawei had an unexpected gift: Samsung\u2019s devices kept on catching on fire.\n\n\"Their problem has given Huawei more opportunity to be in the market,\" Mr Yu said, though he felt the Mate 9 would have given Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 a run for its money even without the problems.\n\nHe said China deserved its reputation as an imitator in years past, but was quickly shaking off that image.\n\n\"Chinese vendors are getting stronger and stronger on innovation.\n\n\"It's not like 10, 20 years ago where many in China would learn [from the West]. There is more original innovation from China now.\n\nOne Chinese telecoms firm, ZTE, impressed CES crowds with a spot of American basketball - on stilts\n\n\"Thirty years ago China was a very poor country. Like North Korea. Very poor. Nothing.\n\n\"Within 30 years everywhere in China is changing, growing. In Huawei we have huge investment in innovation.\"\n\nThis year he said he expected the company to spend $10bn (\u00a38.1bn) on research and development - roughly in line with Apple.\n\nBut spend isn't everything. No amount of money can buy a Steve Jobs or a Jony Ive. And the cultural boundaries are proving both frustrating and fascinating - what is a massive hit in China can fall desperately flat elsewhere.\n\nBut while American firms have struggled to make headway in China, Chinese firms are accelerating into the West. With high specifications and low prices, you shouldn't bet against them.Om Puri was known for his gritty performances\n\nOne of India's finest actors, Om Puri, died in Mumbai on Friday, aged 66. Film writer Aseem Chhabra believes he never got the recognition he deserved.\n\nIn one scene he spoke in a delightful Punjabi accented English and cautiously suggested to Charlie Wilson, a Congressman from Texas played by Tom Hanks, that covert aid to the mujahideen, fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, should pass through the hands of the Pakistani government.\n\nI wanted to write something on this terrific actor, one of the few from India who straddled so many film spaces - from Bollywood to Indian art house indies, British Asian immigrant stories and big Hollywood productions.\n\nBut the publicists for the film and even the studio Universal Pictures informed me that they had no images of Puri.\n\nSadly this amazing actor had left no impression on the publicists who were mostly focused on promoting Hanks and his co-star Julia Roberts.\n\nPuri acted in over 300 film projects in India and abroad, and yet he did not get the kind of recognition that he surely deserved.\n\nHe won two National Awards in India in the acting category (Arohan, 1982 and Ardh Satya, 1983), and was recognised at a number of film festivals, including a lifetime achievement medal at the prestigious Telluride Film Festival.\n\nDirector Roland Joff\u00e9 cast Puri in a supporting role in City of Joy\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Om Puri found international fame for his roles in films such as East is East\n\nHe was even nominated for a Bafta film award in 2000 for playing the lead in Ayub Khan Din's autobiographical British film East is East.\n\nBut unfortunately in the last decade or so Puri, the actor, was largely forgotten in the West and even in India.\n\nHe did play one last big role in the West - that of an Indian chef in a remote French town in The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014), opposite a feisty Helen Mirren.\n\nIt was a rare moment when Puri was suddenly, albeit briefly, the focus of a film produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWhile promoting that film, Puri told me that Hindi cinema mostly concentrated on younger, good-looking actors. And the industry had relegated him to roles of the father of a lead actor or a police officer. He was rarely offered meaty roles, he complained.\n\nHe was always hungry for more challenging work and recognition.\n\nIn another interview while promoting East is East (1999), Puri told me that his big regret was that he would never get the kind of roles given to Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro.\n\nBut Om Puri was as great an actor as Hoffman and De Niro.\n\nIn fact, one can say he was even better, given the number of films he acted in and the range of his performances.\n\nPuri (left extreme)'s comic timing was perfect in Jaane Bhi Do Yaro\n\nPuri was one of the most versatile Indian actors\n\nHis comic timing was perfect and we can see that in the cult classic indie Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983) and later on in Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool - a modern-day take on Macbeth, where Puri played one of the witches, along with his colleague and friend Naseeruddin Shah.\n\nAlso in the same time period he played a sleazy photographer in Shyam Benegal's Mandi (1983).\n\nHe was the voice of an angry, frustrated cop in Ardh Satya (1983), but was equally charming and seductive with his co-star, the late Smita Patil. And in Aakrosh (1980) he was the oppressed peasant who barely uttered a word.\n\nPuri became one of the first Indian actors of his generation to crossover to the West with his work in British films - East is East, its less successful sequel West is West (2010), the rarely seen Brothers in Trouble (1995), the Hanif Kureishi scripted My Son the Fanatic (1997), and the mini-series White Teeth (2002), based on Zadie Smith's bestseller novel.\n\nThat was a time when nearly every Indian or Pakistani role in a British production was offered to Puri.\n\nHollywood came calling as well.\n\nMike Nichols also cast him in an important role in Wolf (1994) where Puri shared screen time with Jack Nicholson. And earlier Roland Joff\u00e9 cast him in a supporting role in City of Joy (1992).\n\nOm Puri acted in the TV series Jewel in the Crown\n\nIn 1994, Ismail Merchant cast Puri as a hapless college professor who sets out to interview an ageing and overweight Urdu poet (Shashi Kapoor) in In Custody, based on Anita Desai's Man Booker Prize shortlisted novel.\n\nPuri was perfect in the film, displaying his frustration as he observed the decline of Urdu language and poetry.\n\nBut it is the sad reality of the film business, that talented men and women find it harder to get juicy roles as they get older. And Puri had to face that fact.\n\nOm Puri died too soon. But he has left a huge body of work reflecting his four decades as a film actor. He should get the most attention that a master actor of his stature deserves.It's the weekly news quiz - have you been paying attention to what's been going on in the world over the past seven days?\n\nIf you missed this week's quiz on famous resignations, try it here\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TwitterBritish geographer, conservationist and author William Lindesay has had a lifelong obsession with the Great Wall of China.\n\nThree decades ago, he left his home on Merseyside to live near the wall so he might better be able to study it.\n\nIn 2016 he and his family travelled 15,000km (9,320 miles) around the wall network, filming it from the air with a drone.\n\nMr Lindesay and his sons, Jim and Thomas, spoke to the BBC about their epic journey and how they shot it.\n\nRead their full story here: One man's mission to walk Great Wall\n\nFootage by James and Thomas Lindesay at Depictograph.The murder of a 17-year-old boy whose dismembered body parts were found in suitcases in", ", a candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee, told Washington's The Hill newspaper. \"Expect Trump and his henchmen to push restrictive photo ID, limit early voting and make it harder to register.\"\n\nA national version of the state-level laws in places like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina - which Democrats attribute to causing lower turnout levels for Mrs Clinton in those key swing states - would be a worst-case scenario for liberals. But it's just part of the current battle over voting procedures.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts penned a Supreme Court opinion that opened the door to new voting regulations\n\nThe courts have been the site of some of the fiercest fights over voting rights in the past decade. There are multiple ongoing cases dealing with voter identification measures being considered by lower-level courts, including a challenge to a Texas law that had been supported by the Obama administration but could now be opposed by Trump lawyers.\n\nPerhaps the most significant change in US voting law came from the Supreme Court in 2013, when it struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act that required the federal government to pre-authorise any changes in balloting procedures in certain states and jurisdictions, many in the South, that had a history of voting discrimination.\n\nThat decision made it significantly easier for previously covered areas to implement the aforementioned voting restrictions - identification laws and early voting curtailment, in addition to the closing or relocation of polling stations.\n\nConservatives have responded that such measures are necessary to ensure voting security - and, in any event, things like early voting are a recent development that have no constitutional protections. They argue that photo identification, required to board a plane or cash a cheque, are an everyday fact of life that present no significant burden to voters.\n\nMake no mistake, however, this fight over voter fraud is - at its heart - a nakedly partisan battle. As Republican legislators North Carolina made clear when they studied voting demographics and photo ID possession while crafting their state's election laws, it's a way to cut into their opposition's base.\n\nCivil rights activists in North Carolina protest to defend their voting rights\n\n\"Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was,\" long-time North Carolina Republican strategist Carter Wrenn told the Washington Post. \"It wasn't about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat.\"\n\nDemocrats, one the other hand, tend to exaggerate the impact of identification laws and dismiss studies that show little effect on turnout.\n\n\"Despite Republican legislators' best attempts to suppress minority voters, study after study has found that voter ID laws have little to no effect on voter turnout,\" writes Vox's German Lopez. \"At worst, the effect is small - barely detectable even in studies that employ multiple controls. At best, there's no effect at all or even an increase.\"\n\nOther voting changes, like polling place consolidation and early voting curtailment, could have a more pronounced impact, however - and while it's unlikely any move in that regard would come at the national level, Mr Trump's rhetoric could provide cover for further state efforts.\n\nIn particular, the Trump administration may be taking particular aim at Democratic states. During a recent briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said that the coming voting fraud investigation could take a closer look at California and New York - two traditionally Democratic states that overwhelmingly backed Mrs Clinton last year. '\n\nAdd that to the already released plans to put the squeeze on cities - primarily in liberal states - that offer \"sanctuary\" to undocumented workers, and it seems increasingly like the Trump administration has political payback on its mind.Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nWes Morgan salvaged a replay for Leicester City in an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Derby County which will be remembered for a remarkable Darren Bent own goal.\n\nRams striker Bent put the Premier League champions ahead when he scuffed a clearance into his own net while under no pressure trying to clear a corner.\n\nHowever, the former England forward made up for that when he headed Will Hughes' cross into the right net to level the scores.\n\nCraig Bryson put Championship side Derby ahead when he picked the ball up 25 yards out, surged past three Foxes defenders and fired the ball across Kasper Schmeichel with a slight deflection off Robert Huth.\n\nLeicester, who hit the post through Demarai Gray, looked as if they were heading out of the cup before captain Morgan headed home Gray's corner.\n\nDerby had a late penalty appeal turned down when Abdoul Camara's shot hit Huth's hand.\n\nThe replay at the King Power Stadium will be played on Wednesday, 8 February (19:45 GMT).\n\nBent has made a career from close-range tap-ins, but he has never 'scored' one like his opener before.\n\nMarc Albrighton's corner was headed towards goal by Foxes defender Huth. The ball fell to Chris Baird, who tried to control the ball on his thigh but it went away from him back towards team-mate Bent.\n\nThe former Sunderland striker, standing just in front of the line, had plenty of time to control the ball or smash it to safety. But as he swung his foot to clear, the ball hit the side of his boot and flew behind him into the back of the net.\n\nMatch of the Day summariser Graeme Le Saux called it \"just the most bizarre goal\". The former England defender added: \"It is just terrible. From an experienced player, he's got time, he sees the ball. How he fails to get decent contact on it, baffling. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. He almost kicks it backwards into the net.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 live's Andy Townsend said: \"He could have taken a touch before clearing. He didn't need to slash at it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" said Bent after the game. \"I lost concentration and tried to hit the ball as hard as I could and it flew into the net. It wasn't the greatest start. Fair play to us to stick at it.\"\n\nBent made amends with a goal at the right end when Schmeichel punched a corner to Hughes, whose cross was met by Bent with a glancing header to turn the ball past the keeper into the corner of the net.\n\n\"It was playing on my mind, I thought 'what have I done here'? But I scored at the other end,\" he added.\n\nThe 32-year-old striker has now scored in 10 of his past 11 FA Cup games, including all five for Derby.\n\nThe Foxes rescue a replay they scarcely want\n\nLeicester named a strong team, with nine of their regular starting 11 from last season's title-winning team starting - and a 10th, Riyad Mahrez, coming on midway through the second half.\n\nBut as has been the case for most of their title defence so far - they sit five points above the relegation zone - they looked nothing like the 2015-16 legends.\n\nHowever, they did have enough chances to score before eventually equalising.\n\nHalf-time substitute Gray should have levelled when Albrighton's cross was punched away by Scott Carson to the winger, who fired the rebound straight at the former England keeper.\n\nAnd then moments later, he went even closer when his low shot from the edge of the box hit the post. The ball fell to Shinji Okazaki, whose first effort was blocked and his second - like his team-mate had done a minute before - went straight at Carson, who was on the ground.\n\nAnd, as if to sum up the difference between this season and last, Jamie Vardy - scorer of 24 goals last term and six this time around - headed straight at Carson from about six yards out.\n\nBut Morgan kept them in the cup with his late intervention, albeit in a replay neither side really wanted.\n\nWhile Derby are challenging for the play-offs, Leicester now have to juggle a Premier League relegation battle, a campaign in the Champions League knockout stages and an FA Cup replay.\n\nDerby boss Steve McClaren joked after the game that he would have brought on more strikers at the end to force a winner for either side if he could.\n\nMan of the match - Will Hughes (Derby County)\n\nManager reaction - 'We have to concentrate'\n\nDerby manager Steve McClaren: \"We did everything we could, we came across a team who were at it tonight.

Sir David told Prince William it was \"difficult to overstate\" the threat of climate change\n\nSir David Attenborough has told Prince William that people have never been more \"out of touch\" with the natural world than they are today.\n\nIn an interview with the prince at the World Economic Forum, the naturalist warned: \"We can wreck it with ease, we can wreck it without even noticing.\"\n\nSir David said people must care, respect and revere the natural world.\n\nHeeding his words, the prince said: \"Work to save the planet is probably going to largely happen on our watch\".\n\nSir David, 92, said: \"When I started 60 years ago in the mid-50s, to be truthful, I don't think there was anybody who thought that there was a danger that we might annihilate part of the natural world.\"\n\nIn his early career, he said, simply showing people a new animal on television would astound them.\n\nEven then, he added: \"Television in Britain in the 50s was only seen by a few million people in southern England.\"\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator said: \"Now we can go everywhere, we can go into the bottom of the sea, we can go into space, we can use drones, we can use helicopters, we can use macroworlds, we can speed things up, we can slow things down, we can film in the darkness - and so the natural world has never been exposed to this degree before.\"\n\nHis new series, Our Planet, due to air on Netflix, could reach 150 million people immediately, he said, \"and go on being seen - by word of mouth\".\n\nDespite this, he said, with more people than ever living in towns, \"the paradox (is) that there has never been a time when more people are out of touch with the natural world than there's now\".\n\nHe warned: \"It's not just a question of beauty or interest or wonder, it's the essential ingredient, essential part of human life is a healthy planet.\n\n\"We are in the danger of wrecking that\".\n\nHe said that for a very long time people have viewed the natural world in opposition to the urban world.\n\n\"It is not, we are all one world,\" he said, adding that global leaders are beginning to see that everything we do has implications.\n\nHe said: \"That fundamental, beautiful fact is now being recognised.\"\n\nSir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship\n\nIn his interview with the Duke of Cambridge, Sir David said it was \"difficult to overstate\" the climate change crisis.\n\nHe added: \"We are now so numerous, so powerful, so all pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening that we can exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it.\n\n\"We have now to be really aware of the dangers that we are doing.\n\n\"And we already know that of course the plastics problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage on marine life - the extent of which we don't yet fully know.\"\n\nLast year, Sir David said he was \"astonished\" by the response to Blue Planet II, which raised the issue of single-use plastics and the damage they were doing to the world's oceans.\n\nSir David was given a Crystal Award at the forum on Monday for his leadership in environmental stewardship.\n\nAccepting the award, the veteran broadcaster urged leaders to come up with \"practical solutions\".\n\nHe told the prince: \"The point is that we have this option ahead of us - we have to take the option to protect the natural world\u2026 that's where the future lies.\n\n\"There's a source of great optimism there, we have the knowledge, we have the power, to live in harmony with that natural world\".\n\nPrince William has previously described Sir David as having \"the single most important impact in my conservation thinking\".\n\nIntroducing Sir David, he said it was a \"personal treat\" to interview the broadcaster.\n\nIn a BBC tribute programme marking Sir David's 90th birthday in 2016, the duke called him a \"national treasure\".\n\nHe added: \"I used to love, and I still do, but when I was a young boy, used to love turning on the television and watching David's programmes and really feeling like I was back out in Africa or I was learning about something magical and almost out of this planet.\"\n\nThe duke said: \"There is something very reassuring about seeing David Attenborough on BBC One doing his documentaries. It is part of the national psyche now.\"\n\nThe Queen and Sir David came together last year for an ITV documentary\n\nSir David turned 90 in the same year as the Queen, and paid his own tribute at her official birthday celebrations at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThey also took part in an ITV documentary last year which looked at the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy project.\n\nSir David and the Queen, who were born just weeks apart, chuckled over a forlorn-looking tree in the Buckingham Palace grounds which the Queen suggested had been \"sat on\" at a garden party.\n\nWhen Sir David suggested climate change might lead to \"all kinds of different trees growing here in another 50 years\", the Queen quipped: \"It might easily be, yes. I won't be here though.\"\n\nPrince William, who is patron of the Tusk conservation charity, has in the past warned over the impact of the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking.\n\nIn 2016, he urged the UK government to push ahead with a total ban on", "artime Europe, in a place that witnessed some of the worst of man's inhumanity to man.\n\nIt would not be shared until he was in his 80s, thousands of miles from that place.\n\nLale had been the Tattooist of Auschwitz.\n\nLiving out his life in a suburb of Melbourne, the man who had been born Ludwig \"Lale\" Eisenberg to Jewish parents in Slovakia in 1916 decided to share his story.\n\n\"This man, the tattooist from the most infamous concentration camp, kept his secret safe in the mistaken belief that he had something to hide,\" says Heather Morris, who spent three years recording Lale's story before he died in 2006.\n\nShe has now written a book - The Tattooist of Auschwitz - based on how he tattooed a serial number on the arms of those at the camp who weren't sent to the gas chambers.\n\n\"The horrors of surviving nearly three years in a concentration camp left him with a lifetime of fear and paranoia,\" she says.\n\n\"The story took three years to untangle. I had to earn his trust and it took time before he was willing to embark on the deep self-scrutiny that parts of his story required.\"\n\nHe feared that he would be viewed as a Nazi collaborator. Keeping the secret, or what he described as a burden of guilt, would protect his family, he thought.\n\nIt was only after his wife Gita died that he \"unburdened\" himself, revealing a tale not only of survival but of deep love.\n\nIn April 1942, aged 26, Lale was taken to Auschwitz, the Nazis' biggest death camp.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to his hometown, Lale had offered himself as a strong, able-bodied young man in the hope that it would save the rest of his family from being split up. Unlike his siblings, he was unemployed and unmarried.\n\nAt that time, he did not know of the horrors that went on at the camp in occupied south-west Poland.\n\nOn arrival, the Nazis exchanged his name for a number: 32407.\n\nPrisoner number 32407 was set to work like many others, constructing new housing blocks as the camp expanded.\n\nRead more on the Holocaust:\n\nHe spent hours working on the rooftops, keeping a low profile from the SS guards and their unpredictable tempers.\n\nBut shortly after he arrived at Auschwitz, Lale contracted typhoid.\n\nHe was cared for by the man who had given him his identification tattoo, a French academic named Pepan.\n\nPepan took Lale under his wing and set him to work as his assistant. He taught him not only the trade, but how to keep his head down and his mouth shut.\n\nThen one day Pepan disappeared, shipped out. Lale would never find out what happened to him.\n\nPartly because of his skills with languages - he knew Slovakian, German, Russian, French, Hungarian and a bit of Polish - Lale was made the main tattooist, the tetovierer, of the death camp.\n\nHe was given a bag full of tattooing supplies and a paper bearing the words: Politische Abteilung.\n\nLale now worked for the Political Wing of the SS. An officer was assigned to monitor him, which gave him a semblance of protection.\n\nAerial view of Auschwitz in World War Two\n\nAs the tetovierer, Lale lived a step further away from death than the other prisoners.\n\nHe ate in an administration building. He was given extra rations. He slept in a single room. When his work was done, or when there were no new prisoners to tattoo, he was allowed free time.\n\n\"He never, ever saw himself as being a collaborator,\" Morris says.\n\nIt was a real concern after the war - many saw the prisoners who worked for the SS at the camps as having taken part in their brutality.\n\n\"He did what he did to survive. He said he wasn't told he could have this job or that job,'' says Morris.\n\n\"He said you took whatever was being offered. You took it and you were grateful because it meant that you might wake up the next morning.\"\n\nDespite his privileges, the threat of not waking up the next day was ever present.\n\n\"[Josef] Mengele, in particular, was a common sight as he chose his 'patients' from the new arrivals, sending them Lale's way,\" Morris wrote.\n\n\"On many occasions while whistling an operatic tune, he would sidle up to Lale and loudly terrorise him: 'One day, tetovierer, I will take you - one day.'\"\n\nChild prisoners at Auschwitz - photographed on orders of Josef Mengele\n\nFor the next two years, Lale would tattoo hundreds of thousands of prisoners, with the help of assistants.\n\nThese forced tattoos, the numbers shaky and stark against pale forearms, have become one of the most recognisable symbols of the Holocaust and its deadliest camp.\n\nOnly prisoners at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, Birkenau and Monowitz, were tattooed.\n\nThe practice began in autumn 1941 and by the spring of 1943, all prisoners were tattooed.\n\nAt first, a metal stamp was used to imprint the entire number into the skin. Ink was rubbed into the wound.\n\nWhen this method proved inefficient, the SS introduced a twin-needle device.\n\nThis is the tool Lale used during his time as tattooist.\n\nWhen prisoners arrived at Auschwitz, they were selected either for forced labour or immediate execution.\n\nTheir heads were shaved, their belongings taken.\n\nThey exchanged their clothes for rags, and then lined up to receive their mark from the tetovierer.\n\nThe only exceptions to this branding were the \"re-education\" prisoners of German ethnic origin and those sent directly to the gas chambers.\n\nIt was the final peg in the brutal \"registration\" process, says Dr Piotr Setkiewicz, head of the research centre at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum.\n\n\"It was one thing in a series of humiliating, dehumanising things that happened on arrival to the camp.\n\n\"First it was painful, and second they understood at this moment they were losing their names. From this time on, the prisoners did not use officially their names. They had to use their numbers.\"\n\nIt's July 1942 and Lale is handed another piece of paper. In front of him are five digits: 3 4 9 0 2.\n\nTattooing men is one thing, but when he holds the thin arm of a young girl in his hands, he feels horrified.\n\nHe has not yet been made the tetovierer. Pepan urges him to do as he's told. If he doesn't, he will condemn himself to death.\n\nThere is something about this girl and her bright eyes.\n\nYears later, Lale will tell Morris how in that moment, as he tattooed her number on her left arm, she tattooed her number in his heart.\n\nHe learned that her name was Gita - she was in the women's camp, Birkenau.\n\nWith the help of Lale's personal SS guard, he would smuggle letters to her. Letters led to secretive visits outside her block.\n\nHe tried to take care of her, sneaking her his extra rations, even getting her moved to a better work station. He tried to give her hope.\n\n\"Gita, she had her doubts, very strong doubts,\" Morris says.\n\n\"She didn't see a future. He always, deep down, knew that he was going to survive. He didn't know how, but it comes back to that whole notion of being a survivor.

But that came to an end when he left his post in August 2017 as their relationship began to cool.\n\nHe left the White House after months of reported power struggles with Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kush", "who will be standing in Africa in 2017 is Donald Trump.\n\nYes, I know it's an act of treason to associate him with Africa.\n\nBut when he's sworn in as president, his foreign policy (or tweetplomacy) will have a bearing on our continent.\n\nHis critics warn that his isolationist stand might mean less attention will be paid to Africa.\n\nBut it could just force Africans to find solutions from within, by strengthening our institutions, improving infrastructure, governance and security and trading more amongst ourselves.\n\nAnother man who also takes office in January is Nana Akufo-Addo, the president-elect of Ghana.\n\nGhana's Nana Akufo-Addo (pictured in background in pink, and on T-shirt) takes over in 2017\n\nHe's tried to enter Flagstaff House (the presidential residency) through the ballot box as the New Patriotic Party candidate since 2008.\n\nNow that he has the keys, Ghanaians will wait to see how he delivers his pledge of one district, one factory, lest he becomes one man, one term.\n\nAnd then there's the state of emergency in Ethiopia, which still stands.\n\nIt was put in place last October following violent protests.\n\nThe government says the security situation has improved save for some clashes in the northern part of Amhara region.\n\nSome 9,000 people detained under the state of emergency have been released and the government says it could lift the emergency before its six-month period is over.\n\nThere are two prominent men who will be kneeling before voters to ask for a job.\n\nPaul Kagame has been president for the last 16 years, but Rwandans appear to want more of him and have voted to remove the term-limit barrier.\n\nIn August, Mr Kagame will therefore use his constitutional right to ask for a new employment contract.\n\nRwanda's Paul Kagame (L) and Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta are both seeking re-election in 2017\n\nIn the same month, his Kenyan neighbour Uhuru Kenyatta will also be reapplying for his job.\n\nLast September, while warning the main opposition leader Raila Odinga to mind his own party and leave the ruling Jubilee party alone, President Kenyatta famously said: \"\u2026 as you continue to search for a seat and salivate, we are feasting on the meat\".\n\nIt will be clear in August whether Kenyans will give Jubilee more time to feast or turn the party itself into mince meat.\n\n\"The Nigerian economy... enters 2017 in the squat position\"\n\nThe African Union has been searching for a new Chief Executive Officer and will fill the position in January.\n\nThree men and two women from Botswana, Kenya, Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea will fight it out to replace the outgoing South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as Chair of the AU Commission.\n\nNow to some situations and people who can't decide whether to stand or sit.\n\nThe Nigerian economy has caught its nastiest stomach bug in more than two decades.\n\nAnd so it enters 2017 in the squat position.\n\nA combination of factors including a crash in the global price of oil, which Nigeria relies a lot on, and a fall in the naira, the country's currency, contributed to the sizeable contraction of the economy in 2016.\n\nThe anger and frustration among the people was aptly captured by this online comment from one Nigerian in November: \"We are now going into depression and deep S***! Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!\"\n\nNigeria's economy has a lot of ground to make up\n\nOver in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House.\n\nHe lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat.\n\nA little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind.\n\nAfrica and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant.\n\nAs his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office.\n\nThere are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017.\n\nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia.\n\nOne of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah.\n\nThe former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year.\n\nAngolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years.\n\nMany young Congolese are hoping President Kabila will go without a fight\n\nAlthough Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola.\n\nHis daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola.\n\nIn neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko.\n\nLaurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired.\n\nViolent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year.\n\nThe theme of falling is alive in South Africa.\n\nThe #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students.\n\n2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase.\n\nAnd then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma.\n\nHemlines are just one of the many things that could fall in 2017\n\nIn December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019.\n\nAllowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide.\n\nSo will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances?\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute.\n\nA number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice.\n\nAnd now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself.\n\nA quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee.\n\nApparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa.\n\nThe region has a terrible record in continental football.\n\nUganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final.\n\nUganda are hoping to become the first East African winners of Afcon for 55 years\n\nKenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall.\n\nIn politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and", "farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal.\n\n\"This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,\" said Dr Nicol\u00e1s G\u00e1lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the g\u00fci\u00f1a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss.\n\nThey say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the g\u00fci\u00f1a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat.\n\nThe wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile\n\nThis is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say.\n\nAnother threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens.\n\nQuestionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a g\u00fci\u00f1a over the last decade.\n\n\"This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,\" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent.\n\nThe research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology provides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat.\n\nThe approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

the lowest level of promotional activity at Christmas since 2009.\"\n\nTesco was the fastest growing of the big supermarkets over the period, with sales up by 3.1% over the 12 weeks, while Aldi and Lidl were neck and neck in the chase to be the country's fastest growing supermarket overall, with sales rises of 16.8% year-on-year.\n\n\"In some ways Christmas is a tricky time for the discounters: they tend to lose a little market share compared to earlier in the year as many shoppers return to the more traditional supermarkets in search of old favourites,\" added Mr McKevitt.\n\n\"Rising to the challenge, Aldi and Lidl collectively managed to attract nearly one million additional households during the past three months.\"\n\nThe BRC, which produces its data with consultancy KPMG, said shoppers' spending power \"had been absorbed by essential items\".\n\nIt said this had forced shops which did not sell food to discount heavily in the lead-up to Christmas to try and encourage shoppers to spend more.\n\nWhilst this had helped boost overall sales, the BRC said it hit many retailers' profits for the period.\n\nOver the three months to December last year, sales of non-food items fell 3.7% - marking their steepest drop in five years, the BRC's figures showed.\n\nMeanwhile, food sales for the same period rose 4.2%, their biggest rise in six months.\n\n\"The divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,\" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.\n\nInflation is currently at a near six-year high of 3.1%, easily outpacing the growth in average earnings.\n\nThe latest official data shows that food inflation in particular has picked up, with prices for fish, oil and fats such as butter and chocolate all higher.\n\nThis means that many shoppers are spending more on basic essentials.\n\nMajor non-food retailers have already indicated that they are feeling the strain.\n\nOn Monday, baby products chain Mothercare warned that annual profits would be substantially lower due to weak Christmas sales.\n\nIt subsequently emerged that rival chain House of Fraser was seeking to reduce rents on some of its stores, suggesting that it too was struggling.\n\nHowever, sales at Next unexpectedly rose over the Christmas period, prompting the fashion retailer to raise its profit forecast.\n\nSupermarket group Morrisons is due to report its festive trading figures later with Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis and Waitrose set to report later in the week.Millions of Britons are being encouraged to say they were sick while on holiday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.\n\nA poll carried out for ABTA suggests that 19% of all holidaymakers may have been approached by a claims management company on their return home.\n\nThey are told that there is money waiting for them if they file a claim.\n\nOn average, successful claimants get payouts of just over \u00a32,000 each.\n\nAs many as nine million Britons have been approached to make such sickness claims, the poll suggests.\n\nIn 2016 the travel industry spent more than \u00a3240m fighting claims, making all holiday packages more expensive.\n\nThe government has already announced plans to discourage such activity, but ABTA said any new rules need to be in place before the 2018 holiday season.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it was trying to implement the changes as quickly as possible.\n\nSince 2013 the industry has reported a 500% rise in reports of sickness while customers are away, even though the hotels involved say the number of cases has remained static.\n\nThe rise in claims also appears to be confined to holidaymakers who come from the UK.\n\nThe poll suggests that few people know such claims can end with a prison sentence.\n\nUnder existing law, those who commit such fraud can face a sentence of up to three years.\n\nSome holidaymakers are told to claim they got food poisoning on holiday\n\nIn October last year, a couple from Merseyside were jailed after pretending to be sick on holiday.\n\nAnd last week a Derbyshire couple pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming a trip to Turkey was ruined by diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\n\"Unscrupulous claims management companies are encouraging people to make a false sickness claim which could land them with a large fine or even a prison sentence,\" said Mark Tanzer, ABTA's chief executive.\n\nThe government announced a crackdown on false claims last July, and has since carried out a consultation.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is planning to introduce fixed legal costs for firms defending themselves, making the costs of claims more predictable.\n\nThe payouts themselves will also be subject to stricter controls.\n\n\"We are determined to tackle the holiday sickness claims culture which is damaging the honest majority,\" an MoJ spokesperson said.\n\n\"That is why we have set out plans to bring costs under control in these cases, reducing the cash incentives to bring claims against tour operators.

It mustn't be fancy,\" she told US radio station NPR in a rare 2012 interview.\n\nShe added: \"The two things I loved from a very early age were the natural world and dead poets, [who] were my pals when I was a kid.\"\n\nOliver described her family as \"dysfunctional\", and though she studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, she never graduated. She would later dismiss much of her education in an essay as \"such a pre-established collection of certainties\".\n\nOliver's great love was the photographer Molly Malone Cook, to whom she dedicated much of her work. In Our World, she wrote of her partner: \"I took one look and fell, hook and tumble\". The pair met in the late 1950s, and remained together until Cook's death in 2005.\n\nIn 1998, Oliver was granted the Lannan Literary Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nShe wrote about human mortality with the tone of someone counting her blessings.\n\n\"When it's over,\" she wrote in When Death Comes, \"I want to say: all my life / I was a bride married to amazement.

As nuclear plants go in the UK, it is a big one.\n\nIt represents a real economic opportunity for north Wales to grow and would create about 9,000 jobs for people during construction.\n\nThere are plans to build two to three power plants at Wylfa in Anglesey and another in Gloucestershire, producing nuclear energy in the 2020s.\n\nIt is a huge chance for young people to get highly skilled, well paid work and for businesses in north Wales to grow.\n\nAnd it could have ripple effects throughout the whole of Wales, by bringing \u00a35.7bn to the Welsh economy, according to independent research.\n\nWelsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the scheme would be the \"biggest infrastructure project in Wales for a generation\".\n\nThe original Wylfa Nuclear power station was decommissioned in 2015\n\nWho is Hitachi and why is it thinking of pulling out?\n\nBig nuclear plans like Wylfa do not come cheap. It is a multi-billion pound investment being carried out by giant Japanese tech company Hitachi.\n\nBut there are worries Hitachi may ditch the project - especially since announcing it will suspend it - because construction costs could rise, and uncertainty about what Brexit will mean.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Theresa May on Thursday - but Wylfa was not discussed\n\nThe company has been in talks with the UK government since June last year to agree how Wylfa Newydd will be paid for.\n\nThese negotiations are critical to the project because it decides how much public money can be invested into Wylfa.\n\nWylfa is an expensive commitment - even for a big company like Hitachi. So it is counting even more on taxpayer money helping them out.\n\nHowever with the UK government's efforts fixed on Brexit, the firm has now \"pressed the pause button\", as an economic adviser put it.\n\nThere is no upfront cash, no solid commitment by the government, so Wylfa Newydd is becoming riskier for Hitachi.\n\nHitachi are in talks with the UK government about Wylfa\n\nWhat happens if Wylfa is later scrapped?\n\nIf Hitachi completely pulls the plug it is bad news for people and businesses in Wales.\n\nIt has just started hiring young apprentices and there is a \u00a390,000 promise for an apprentice training scheme in Anglesey.\n\nSo without the promise of Wylfa, could it mean a brain drain for north Wales?\n\nThis includes people outside Anglesey too.\n\nPeople across north Wales, from Wrexham to Porthmadog hoping to benefit would have to look elsewhere for anything close to this size of engineering opportunity.\n\nSo who is affected if there is no Wylfa?\n\nThe impacts of this would-be investment boost to Wales will be felt by people and Welsh businesses far and wide.\n\nSeventeen-year-olds looking for work at Wylfa would have to look to England for well-paid skilled jobs in the nuclear industry.\n\nAnd businesses in Wales who have already felt the benefit from the nuclear plans, may get less employment.\n\nAs Coleg Menai welding student", "to do mental health first-aid courses.\n\nI'm pushing for the courses to be brought into the curriculum in both primary and secondary schools, as well as in companies, communities, and the military.\n\nI'm a firm believer that experience, education, research, intervention and preparation can potentially save a life.\n\nThe new measures have received praise from some, but others think the government has not gone far enough\n\nMental health services have been in crisis for the last five years.\n\n[In my job as a community psychiatric nurse,] we have no beds or resources.\n\nMy team has over 90 people on its caseload.\n\nWe struggle to cope with 45.\n\nWe take people on to avoid admission, but we have no beds to admit to.\n\nThis year, [after 40 years,] I have had enough, it's time for me to go, I cannot cope with the strain and pressure anymore.\n\nThe government do nothing, they lie and manipulate all the time.\n\nTrust managers know what is happening but are unable to act.\n\nI've had experience of both NHS and private mental health facilities recently, and the NHS is far worse at dealing with mental health issues.\n\nI had quite a bad experience with a GP who was very dismissive of these issues, so I opted to go through a Live Well facility in my local area.\n\nThis was better for me, but still has a very light touch and [is] generic, without any effort or in my view ability to deal with mental health issues.\n\nI'm in a position where I can afford private healthcare, however many are not, so I can only imagine how widespread this issue is.\n\nI'm glad that there will, hopefully, now be a far greater focus on mental health, but there needs to be both words and action to tackle the problem.\n\nMy daughter had anorexia last year.\n\nShe suffers from self-esteem issues and the feeling of needing to be perfect.\n\nShe was diagnosed [at] the beginning of April, but the nearest appointment to see a Camhs worker was the middle of June, which I feared would have been too late for my daughter.\n\nI took her to the GP again due to her deteriorating health, but he told me that I had to wait for the Camhs appointment.\n\nAt this point her weight was in the danger zone, down to five stone.\n\nIn the meantime, I tried manage it all myself, using all kinds of approaches to help my daughter.\n\nWhen she was eventually seen by Camhs, she was so ill she was admitted to hospital.\n\nShe had to stay in a general hospital for two weeks before there was a bed available in a specialist hospital.\n\nBut the nearest bed was over 120 miles from home in Middlesbrough, as there is no provision in the whole of Cumbria.\n\nShe stayed in Middlesbrough for seven weeks - it affected her mental health further by being so far away from home, but in the end it was the best place for her.\n\nWhen she was discharged, she needed to see a dietician, but the only one in Cumbria was off sick.\n\nMy daughter didn't see a dietician for six weeks.\n\nMy main issue is that GPs didn't understand the seriousness of this mental health disorder - the system is woefully inadequate.US Army interpreter Nayyef Hrebid and Iraqi soldier Btoo Allami fell in love at the height of the Iraq War. It was the start of a dangerous 12-year struggle to live together as a couple.\n\nIn 2003, Nayyef Hrebid found himself in the midst of the Iraq war. The fine art graduate had signed up to be a translator for the US Army after he couldn't find a job.\n\n\"I was based in Ramadi, which was the worst place at that time. We would go out on patrols and people would be killed by IEDs [roadside bombs] and snipers. I was asking myself: 'Why am I here? Why am I doing this?'\"\n\nHowever, a chance encounter with a soldier in the Iraqi army changed everything.\n\n\"One day I was sitting outside and this guy came out of the shower block. I saw his hair was shiny and very black and he was smiling. I just thought, 'Oh my god, this guy is really cute.'\n\n\"I felt like something beautiful had happened in this very bad place.\"\n\nHrebid was secretly gay. He hadn't come out because same-sex relationships are taboo in Iraq and gay people are at risk of violent attacks.\n\n\"In Iraq being gay is seen as very wrong and brings shame on your family. You can even get killed for it so you have to be very careful,\" he says.\n\nHrebid worked as a translator for the US army\n\nWhat Hrebid didn't realise was that the soldier, Btoo Allami, was also attracted to him.\n\n\"I had this strange feeling like I had been looking for him. My feelings grew over time and I knew I wanted to talk to him,\" Allami says.\n\nThey had a chance to get to know each other when they took part in a mission to clear insurgents from the city's general hospital.\n\n\"After patrols we would come back to the safe house and one day Btoo invited me over to eat food and talk with him and the other soldiers,\" Hrebid says.\n\n\"We talked night after night and my feelings for him grew. \"\n\nThree days after the dinner, Hrebid and Allami found an excuse to go outside to talk on their own. They sat in a dark parking lot, full of US Humvees.\n\n\"I felt very close to Nayyef and I felt it was time for me to say something,\" Allami says.\n\n\"So I told him about my feelings and that I loved him. And then he kissed me and left. It was an amazing night. I didn't eat for two days afterwards.\"\n\nBtoo, pictured by a Humvee, was a sergeant in the Iraqi army\n\nThe relationship swiftly developed and they spent an increasing amount of time together at the camp.\n\n\"On missions I'd try to be close to him, when I should have been with the Americans. We would walk together and we took some pictures together,\" Hrebid says.\n\nTheir American and Iraqi colleagues soon noticed.\n\n\"I was telling my American captain about Btoo and he helped bring him over to stay with me at the American camp for a few nights,\" says Hrebid.\n\n\"But some of the other soldiers stopped talking to me after they found out I was gay. One of my translator friends from my home city ended up hitting me with a big stick, which broke my arm.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hrebid and Allami were both deployed to Diwaniyah in southern Iraq. They were lucky to be in the same city but still had to keep their relationship secret. But in 2009, Hrebid applied for asylum in America, as his long involvement with the US Army made it too dangerous to stay.\n\n\"I thought I could go and then it would be easy to apply for Btoo to come afterwards,\" Hrebid says.\n\n\"I knew if we stayed in Iraq we had no future. We were going to end up married to women and hiding our whole lives. But I had watched the TV series Queer As Folk and I realised there were gay communities on the other side of the world.\"\n\nHrebid was granted asylum and settled in Seattle. However, his attempts to get a visa for Allami to join him were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Allami's family had discovered he was gay and started putting pressure on him to marry a woman. With help from Hrebid's friend Michael Failla, a refugee activist, he escaped to Beirut.\n\n\"It wasn't an easy decision to make as I had a 25-year contract with the army,\" Allami says.\n\n\"Plus I was the only one supporting my family. But I knew I had to be with Nayyef.\"\n\nAllami (left) and Hrebid knew they couldn't live openly as a gay couple in Iraq\n\nAllami applied to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement but his tourist visa ran out before they resolved his case. As an illegal immigrant he had to steer clear of soldiers and checkpoints to avoid being sent back to Iraq.\n\n\"The waiting was hard,\" says Allami.\n\n\"I felt like I was stuck and not moving forward. But then I would speak to Nayyef and that always made me feel stronger.\"\n\nThey talked to each other on Skype every day.\n\n\"He would watch me cook breakfast and I would watch him cook", "ension schemes that their benefits are protected by the PPF.\"\n\nCarillion might not be a household name, but over the years it has absorbed better-known businesses, including Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine.\n\nIt also has a big international business, including a huge construction project in Qatar related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn addition it is a big supplier of construction services to the Canadian government.\n\nIts biggest problems were cost overruns on three UK public sector construction projects:\n\nBernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration Committee, said Carillion's collapse \"really shakes public confidence in the ability of the private sector to deliver public services and infrastructure\".\n\nHis committee is launching an inquiry into government outsourcing following the demise of Carillion.\n\nAre you employed by Carillion?

But Sir Richard said he was unaware of the move and the operator must never be seen to be \"censoring\" customers.\n\nThe Daily Mail said it welcomed the \"support for freedom of speech\".\n\nIn November, Virgin Trains staff were told in an internal memo \"considerable concern\" had been raised about the Mail's position on issues such as immigration, LGBT rights and unemployment.\n\nThe memo added the paper was \"not compatible\" with the company's beliefs.\n\nLast week, Virgin said it regularly reviewed its on-board products and it had never sold the newspaper on its East Coast trains, which is under the management of Virgin and Stagecoach.\n\nVirgin West Coast services run between London, the Midlands, the north-west of England and Scotland.\n\nIn Sir Richard's statement, he said the chairman of Stagecoach, Sir Brian Souter, was also not aware of the decision.\n\n\"Brian and I agree that we must not ever be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice.\n\n\"Nor must we be seen to be moralising on behalf of others. Instead we should stand up for the values we hold dear and defend them publicly, as I have done with the Mail on many issues over the years.\"\n\nSir Richard added a full review of Virgin Trains' sales policy would be carried out but this should not \"single out individual media titles\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Leader of UKIP tells Today Jo Marney views not in line with her 'core beliefs'\n\nUKIP leader Henry Bolton says he has ended his relationship with his girlfriend after she reportedly made racist comments about Meghan Markle.\n\nHe said their romance was \"obviously quite incompatible\" with his leader role but he had no intention to quit.\n\nJo Marney had sent texts saying black people were ugly and Prince Harry's fiancee would \"taint\" the Royal Family.\n\nUKIP's chairman said it \"remains to be seen\" whether Mr Bolton would stay as party leader.\n\nMs Marney has apologised for her remarks, which were reported in the Mail on Sunday, and claimed they were taken out of context.\n\nMr Bolton, a former army officer, took over as UKIP leader in September, becoming the party's fourth leader in 18 months.\n\nHe said it was against UKIP's constitution \"to be racist in any way\".\n\nBut senior party members have questioned his judgement, calling his private life an \"unhelpful distraction\".\n\nMEP Bill Etheridge, who stood in the last leadership election, has called on Mr Bolton to quit, saying", "s Mary Creagh, said a new Act of Parliament was needed after Brexit.\n\n\"We don't want to go back to being the 'dirty man of Europe',\" she added.\n\nMany wildflower meadows have been destroyed\n\nThursday's announcements are the culmination of an environmental week for the government.

He is critically ill in hospital.\n\nSupt Mark Lawrence said: \"Whilst it is unusual for so many people to be arrested in the early stages of an investigation such as this, due to a lack of co-operation and the necessity of securing essential evidence following a serious assault this action was appropriate.\"\n\nA tattoo parlour, the Southern Belle pub and a Sainsbury's Local supermarket are all within a police cordon, according to BBC Radio London's Greg McKenzie who has been reporting from the scene.\n\nBlood was seen on the pavement within one of the three taped off areas.

It sounded like squealing girls like you get on a night out,\" she added.\n\nAnother neighbour, Mason El Hage, 22, said: \"I have never seen something like that in my life.

grassroots group of head teachers.\n\nWest Sussex head teacher Jules White, the group's leader, said there were widespread concerns over school funding shortages among the 7,000 head teachers supporting the campaign.\n\nThey have complained of having to ask parents for contributions and have cast doubt on what the government says about school budgets.\n\nMr White accused the Department for Education and the Treasury of \"hiding behind slogans\" while schools were \"sliding into greater and greater debt\".\n\nHe said that even though schools were reporting worsening finances they were \"being asked to prop up all manner of other social care and support services\".\n\n\"The notion that head teachers are sitting on pile of cash whilst making awful cuts to their school service and to teacher numbers is fanciful,\" said the school funding campaigner.\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the \"number of schools in deficit is skyrocketing\" but the government was \"refusing to accept that this is creating a crisis\".\n\nWhile the figures show the financial problems in secondary schools, there are fewer primary schools facing such debts.\n\nAnd the Department for Education says that the overall picture across the state school sector is more positive.\n\n\"The report itself shows 94% of academy trusts and almost 90% of local authority maintained schools are reporting a cumulative surplus or breaking even - and, 45% of maintained schools have even been able to increase the level of their cumulative surplus in 2017-18,\" a Department for Education spokesman said.\n\n\"While the core schools and high-needs budget is rising from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face.\n\n\"That is why the education secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools reduce the \u00a310bn they spend on non-staffing costs and ensure every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education.\"Dianne Oxberry was BBC North West Tonight's weather presenter for more than 20 years\n\nAward-winning BBC television and radio presenter Dianne Oxberry has died from cancer aged 51, her family has confirmed.\n\nShe died at the Christie hospital in Manchester on Thursday morning.\n\nOxberry became well-known nationally on Radio 1, working alongside Simon Mayo and Steve Wright, during the 1980s.\n\nAfter studying meteorology, she joined BBC North West Tonight in 1994 as a weather presenter and fronted Inside Out North West's current affairs show.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Tenshin is a true champion and a hell of a fighter.\"\n\nAddressing the Japanese fighter, he added: \"Hold your head up high.\n\n\"I want the fans around the world to support Tenshin, he's a great guy and a great champion.\"\n\nThe rules were very strictly defined with kickboxer Nasukawa reportedly facing a $5m fine if he aimed a kick at his older opponent.\n\nThere were no judges, with only a knockout or technical knockout considered a victory.\n\nBefore the fight, former light-welterweight world champion Amir Khan said the bout was a \"joke\" and was \"hurting boxing\".\n\nMayweather also came out of retirement last year to beat McGregor in the Irishman's first ever boxing match.\n\nThat fight was also criticised as a mismatch prior to one of the richest contests in boxing history, but afterwards BBC Radio 5 live boxing commentator Mike Costello said McGregor had \"proved the doubters wrong\".Late in life, Maria \"Chicha\" Mariani had hope of a new breakthrough in the search for her granddaughter\n\nThe assault on the house on 30th Street, led by 100 soldiers and police officers, began in the early afternoon.\n\nWithin hours, the building in La Plata, Argentina - that had appeared from the outside to be a rabbit farm - was almost destroyed, and all but one of its residents killed.\n\nThe only one to survive was Clara Anah\u00ed Mariani Teruggi, who was three months old. Witnesses would later say she had been taken from the scene by those who had led the assault.\n\nClara's mother, Diana Teruggi, 25, was among those killed in the raid on 24 November 1976.\n\nBehind the fake front of the rabbit farm, she helped run a small printing press. It produced copies of the newspaper for the Montoneros, the left-wing guerrilla group of which she and her husband Daniel Mariani were members.\n\nThe group, which formed in the 1960s, conducted kidnappings and assassinations, and were targeted under the military junta that seized power in Argentina in March 1976.\n\nA little more than eight months after Diana Teruggi was killed, Daniel Mariani too was tracked down and murdered.\n\nTheir daughter would never be found, but the search would consume the life of Daniel's mother, Maria \"Chicha\" Mariani, until her death on Monday aged 94.\n\nFew photos were taken of Clara Anah\u00ed before her disappearance at three months\n\nBaby Clara Anah\u00ed was not the only one to disappear in the years after the coup, though the circumstances of how she went missing - snatched during a raid - were unusual.\n\nIn seven years under military rule up to 1983, at least 500 children were abducted from their mothers in captivity, while about 30,000 people are believed to have been kidnapped and murdered by extremist right-wing groups or the military government.\n\nDespite the threat of violence, those left behind - including Clara's grandmother - sought to find the truth.\n\nDaniel Mariani and Diana Teruggi's bodies have still not been recovered more than 40 years later\n\nIn 1977, art history teacher Chicha Mariani and 11 other relatives of the missing began meeting in secret to discuss how to find their grandchildren. It would later emerge that many of the children had been moved into the homes of military members and their allies.\n\n\"We were convinced we'd soon find our grandchildren,\" Chicha Mariani told Spain's El Pais newspaper in 2015. 'We believed that the government would give them back to us. How naive we were.\n\n\"We even bought nappies, thinking that we would get the little ones back at any time.\"\n\nAfter those early meetings, the grandmothers started investigating. They would visit orphanages and juvenile courts, look into recent adoptions, and follow tips from the public.\n\nIn time, they would become known as the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, after the central Buenos Aires square in which they would congregate in front of the government palace.\n\nThey worked alongside the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had started their own demonstrations in the square, waving white handkerchiefs at those in power.\n\nThe Mothers of Plaza de Mayo at a demonstration in 1982\n\nThe risks of standing up to the government at that time were clear; three of the founding members of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo and two supporters - including a French nun - disappeared in 1977.\n\nTests conducted on their bodies years later indicated they had died after being thrown from a great height, most likely in the Argentine military's \"death flights\", which saw victims thrown from planes into large bodies of water.\n\nThe search became easier after the end of military rule and with advances in technology. One year after the military was overthrown, an American geneticist helped create a \"Grandparents' Index\" in Argentina that was able to determine genetic links between a grandparent and a grandchild.\n\nThen in 1987, under Chicha Mariani's leadership, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo - known as the Abuelas - succeeded in convincing the Argentine government to establish a genetic database for relatives of the disappeared.\n\nThe database helped reunite dozens of families in its first few years, though Chicha Mariani would not be one of the beneficiaries.\n\nMariani split with the Abuelas in 198", "GCSEs.\n\n\"It's a deeply cultural thing,\" says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government.\n\n\"It got built into the British mindset... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort,\" he says.\n\n\"It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university.\n\n\"The others are told, 'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it.\n\n\"And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one.\"\n\nSir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots.\n\nHe is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University.\n\nVince Cable says the Chinese are now the free trade defenders, while the US puts up walls\n\nThere will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about.\n\nSir Vince talks of a \"bizarre Alice in Wonderland world\" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism.\n\n\"You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order,\" he says.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"big fan of the Chinese\", adding: \"like George Osborne\".\n\nSir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians.\n\nHe ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations.\n\nGeorge Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince.\n\nAnd he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession.\n\n\"The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008,\" he says.\n\n\"Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit.\"\n\nHe says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards.\n\nSir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.\n\nMoocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to \u00a39,000 per year.\n\nTuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase.\n\nVince Cable, who put up tuition fees, says the alternative was to cut further education\n\n\"It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful,\" he says.\n\nThe alternative was to cut the further education budget. \"I wasn't willing to go along with that.\"\n\nThe fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees.\n\nHe says he was \"vehemently opposed\" to this promise before the 2010 election.\n\n\"I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster.\n\n\"But there was a very strong head of steam and the leader felt he had to go along with it, and once we were in government we were inevitably exposed.\"\n\nThe Politics of Economics and The Economics of Politicians will be available on Futurelearn from 20 March.\n\u2022 None New York to scrap tuition fees for middle classThe full list of winners at the 89th Academy Awards.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

You might, like Bank of England governor Mark Carney, point out that the economy is", "impact in a big game for the club,\" said Hartley. \"It obviously went horribly wrong.\n\n\"Positive, dominant, hard tackle. That's what I was thinking. Obviously the outcome was different to what I intended.\n\n\"That walk off the field is never a quick moment. It seems to drag on for quite a while, but obviously gives you time to reflect and I understand I could have jeopardised a lot.\n\n\"I put myself and the team in a difficult position and since then I've had clear directives from the management of what they expect and here I am.\"\n\nHartley said that part of the directive from Jones was to improve his tackle technique.\n\n\"I've worked very hard with [England defence coach] Paul Gustard on that,\" added Hartley. \"It's not something that just finishes now that I'm back playing. It's an ongoing thing.\"\n\nHartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by the Australian after he replaced Stuart Lancaster.\n\nThe hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories.Most of the papers lead on the fall-out from the government's Brexit court defeat\n\nThe Brexit Supreme Court ruling makes the lead for nearly all the papers, but one of the most eye-catching headlines can be found in the inside pages of the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Champions of the People\", it proclaims, praising the three justices who found themselves in the minority as they sided with the government in the case.\n\nThe Mail attracted controversy in November when it branded three High Court judges \"enemies of the people\" for ruling Parliament had to be consulted over Brexit.\n\nThe Mail thinks it is not good for democracy that this decision has been now backed by the Supreme Court, arguing this, in effect, turns the EU referendum into a \"mere opinion poll\".\n\nThe Guardian is pleased with the Supreme Court judgement, saying it upheld a major constitutional principle in the face of what it describes as \"shameful attacks\" by the Brexit press.\n\nIt think the government should now publish a formal White Paper on its goals for Brexit.\n\nBut the Financial Times warns MPs against trying to micro-manage the negotiations.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says Parliament has a duty to act responsibly and not seek a re-run of the referendum campaign.\n\n\"What's not to like when British judges in Britain's Supreme Court rule that British law makes the British Parliament sovereign,\" is the Daily Mirror take on Tuesday's Brexit ruling.\n\nBut it is not an opinion that is shared by all the leader writers.\n\nThe Times warns the Lords against trying to frustrate Brexit.\n\nIt would do so at its peril, says the paper, adding: \"Showdowns between the two houses rarely end well for the Lords and the country does not need yet another constitutional headache.\"\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says that ministers are privately warning the government is prepared to flood the Lords with hundreds of Conservative peers if it obstructs the process of leaving the EU.\n\nThe Daily Mail believes new recruits are being discouraged from joining the Army because of historical inquiries into soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt says the Army remains 4% below its required strength, the nearly 7,000 cadets who signed up in the past year being about 3,000 short of the target.\n\nA group campaigning to end the investigations tells the Mail that the figures are no surprise, asking why anyone would want to join the forces when they could be hounded for years.\n\nThe Financial Times thinks the world ought to start taking seriously US President Donald Trump's threat to impose trade tariffs in order to protect American goods.\n\nIn an editorial it argues that many still assume he is bluffing in order to win better deals.\n\nBut, it says, the first few days of his presidency have shown that he is not posturing and he thinks protectionism will make America richer.\n\nThe FT wonders how far he will get before he and his country both discover just how wrong he is.\n\nThe reported Trident missile failure may have made the headlines in recent days, but the Times reminds us that problems involving nuclear submarines are not new.\n\nIt reports on a CIA document which has revealed that a Soviet submarine and an American one, which was carrying a 160 nuclear warheads, crashed into each other in 1974 near Holy Loch, about 30 miles from Glasgow.\n\nOne expert says the crash was so serious there was a danger that the crews could have tried to defend themselves - believing they were under attack - leading to the possibility of war.\n\nThe growing number of homes with wood-burning stoves is partly being blamed for worsening air pollution levels in London, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAir quality readings in some parts of the capital were worse this week than in Beijing.\n\nThe weather and traffic pollution have led to the alert but, according to experts at King's College, wood fires were also responsible with more than a million homes now having the stoves.\n\nDavid Cameron explains in the Times why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK\n\nOn its front page, the Daily Mirror again has photos of drivers clutching their mobiles while out on the road.\n\nFour months after the paper began its campaign to change public attitudes, it asks, \"When will we ever learn?\"\n\nA traffic officer tells the paper he has heard every excuse in the book from the drivers he has pulled over.\n\nHe says one builder tried to throw his phone out the window when he was caught, while another woman insisted she did not own one, until it went off under the seat where she had hidden it.\n\nThe Mirror says cars and vans are deadly weapons in the hands of what it calls \"mobile phone morons\" and calls for more of them to be banned.\n\nIn the Times, David Cameron explains why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nHe says there needs to be a deeper understanding of the disease so that dementia is not accepted as inevitable in later life.\n\nThe paper says the article represents his \"first important political intervention since leaving Downing Street\".\n\nIt thinks Mr Cameron is concerned that Theresa May could downgrade funding for dementia research which for him was a \"personal priority.\"Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nEx-Hull midfielder Jake Livermore says he feared the worst when former team-mate Ryan Mason fractured his skull.\n\nThe England midfielder, 25, clashed heads with Chelsea defender Gary Cahill during Hull's defeat at Stamford Bridge but is making 'excellent progress'.\n\nLivermore - who joined West Brom on Friday and has been in touch with Mason - said: \"It's never nice to see any fellow professional seriously injured.\n\nLivermore played with Mason at both Tottenham and Hull, with Mason becoming the Tigers' record signing when he left White Hart Lane last summer.\n\nMason will continue to be closely monitored by staff at St Mary's Hospital in London.\n\n\"I only spoke to him a couple of days ago and he wished me well at West Brom,\" Livermore said. \"You fear the worst when something like that happens.\n\n\"I know his family very well. Everyone wishes him all the best, fingers crossed he'll be fine.\n\n\"He's a strong character anyway. I've played with him for a long time growing up and I've no doubts he'll be fine.\"\n\nHull fans are being encouraged to show support for Mason by taking part in a minute's applause during Thursday's EFL Cup semi-final against Manchester United at the KCOM Stadium.\n\nThe club wants fans to applaud in the 25th minute to represent the number of Mason's shirt.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg sets out three key points from the ruling\n\nCertainly, the prime minister did not want to find herself in the position of having to ask MPs for permission to start our divorce from the European Union.\n\nToday's verdict from the justices doesn't take away from the reality that having to go to Parliament before triggering Article 50 is a political inconvenience Theresa May very much wanted to avoid.\n\nNor does it change the sentiment among opposition MPs, some of whom are determined to try to amend whatever legislation the government puts forward to", "student Mr Mears had spent two years on bail, but was spared a trial after a diary which supported his case was uncovered and police admitted to errors in investigating the case.\n\nLord Judge told the paper: \"The recent examples in cases involving alleged sexual crime are alarming, both for all the individuals concerned and for public confidence in the administration of criminal justice generally.\"\n\nHe said it was possible that juries were as \"alarmed as everyone else by these cases\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLord Judge said juries \"may wonder\" - even in an apparently strong cases - if they have been provided with all the admissible evidence.\n\n\"These events may reduce the prospects of conviction even when the allegation is genuine,\" he said.\n\nTwo young men both had cases against them dropped in December, prompting Scotland Yard to review about 30 sex crime cases.\n\nThe trial of student Liam Allan, 22, collapsed three days into his trial when police were ordered to hand over phone records showing the alleged victim had pestered Mr Allan for casual sex.\n\nDays later, the prosecution case collapsed against Isaac Itiary after police disclosed \"relevant material\" in response to his defence case statement as his trial was about to start.\n\nA third rape trial, against Samson Makele, collapsed after images emerged of the accused and his alleged victim \"cuddling\" in bed.\n\nThe photos had been discovered on his phone by a defence expert, but had not been disclosed by police or prosecutors.\n\nNazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, agreed with Lord Judge.\n\n\"There is an expectation amongst juries now that they expect scientific and digital internet evidence all the time, and if it's not provided they make a judgement about this,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nHe added: \"What Lord Judge is saying is that juries have expectations. If those expectations aren't met then people who should be convicted aren't being convicted.\"\n\nAlison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, insisted earlier this week that there are \"safeguards in place\" to prevent wrongful imprisonment.\n\nMr Afzal described this as a \"bold statement\".\n\n\"I know of cases where digital evidence and DNA evidence would have perhaps meant that person wasn't convicted,\" he told Today.\n\nMr Afzal, who initiated prosecutions against the so-called Rochdale grooming gang, added that internet giants should be required to assist police investigations.\n\n\"A police officer shouldn't have to - as they currently do - try and scour the internet for the relevant evidence.\"US musician Tom Petty died of an accidental overdose after taking various painkillers, according to a statement issued by his family.\n\nPetty \"suffered from many serious ailments...most significantly a fractured hip\", the statement said.\n\nFamily members say they believe he was overusing prescription pain medication when he died in October aged 66.\n\nPetty found fame as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, with hits like American Girl and Breakdown.\n\nHe was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, recording albums with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison.\n\nPetty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home on 2 October.\n\nHe was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening.\n\n\"On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication\", the statement said.\n\n\"We knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including Fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident.\"\n\nThey added that his death \"may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that is a necessary and healthy discussion\".\n\nThe Los Angeles coroner's office attributed his death to \"multisystem organ failure\" due to a \"mixed toxicity\" of seven medications. They are fentanyl, oxycodone, emazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetyl fentanyl, and despropionyl fentanyl.\n\nYears of over-prescription of opioid painkillers in the US has created a nationwide addiction crisis, with patients turning to heroin and other street drugs when their prescriptions stop.Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump will meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week, Downing Street has confirmed.\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump cancelled plans to open the new $1bn (\u00a3720m) US Embassy in London next month.\n\nThe White House said Mr Trump \"looks forward\" to strengthening the countries' \"special relationship\".\n\nMr Trump is the first sitting US president to attend the forum in the Swiss city since Bill Clinton in 2000.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the \"bilateral meeting\" would take place \"in the margins\" of the forum.\n\nMrs May was the first foreign leader to visit Mr Trump at the White House, after his inauguration in January 2017.\n\nThe two leaders also met at the G7 summit in Sicily in may and at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.\n\nHowever, in November, the prime minister criticised Mr Trump for retweeting three inflammatory videos posted online by the far-right group, Britain First.\n\nAfter Mrs May's spokesman said it was \"wrong for the president to have done this\", he hit back on Twitter and told the British leader to not \"focus on me, focus on the destructive radical Islamic terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Inside the new US embassy\n\nThe reason given for moving the US embassy to Vauxhall was that the current building in Mayfair was too small and modern security was needed.Jewish leaders have called for the resignation of a coroner in north London in a dispute over delays in releasing bodies for burial.\n\nUnder Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nBut Mary Hassell has said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion.\n\nHer jurisdiction includes parts of north London which are home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims.\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews said they had a \"deeply disappointing\" meeting with the senior coroner for Inner North London.\n\nAbdul Hai, councillor with responsibility for community cohesion in the London borough of Camden, has also called for Ms Hassell to quit.\n\nThe board's vice president, Marie Van Der Zyl, told BBC News: \"It's disrupting family life to such an extent that people don't want to die within Inner London North.\n\n\"To say they don't want to die there, they're too frightened to die, is something that's so traumatising and so against Jewish values and indeed it affects Muslims as well.\n\n\"It's at the heart of both of our faiths for there to be speedy burial.\"\n\nMs Van Der Zyl described the early release of bodies to those families who want it as \"basic human rights\" and", "the first six months of the Trump presidency talks openly and on the record about treasonous and unpatriotic behaviour.\n\nPresident Trump boards Air Force One with his then top aide, Steve Bannon\n\nThe firing of Bannon last August the president did with a heavy heart. But it seems that hell hath no fury like a Bannon scorned. Or as President Johnson noted when dealing with the troublesome J Edgar Hoover in the 1960s - better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside pissing in. Bannon is outside, and taking careful aim.\n\nBut if the Bannon accusations are damaging (and they are), there is one aspect of this which will be causing quiet delight in the White House. If you cast your mind back to the summer, the appointment of General John Kelly (and the firing of Bannon) was meant to mark the moment when discipline was imposed on an unruly, freewheeling, chaotic administration.\n\nThere would be a chain of command. Order. Discipline. Systems. Well Steve Bannon was gone, true; but he was still an important voice in the president's ear. Remember this iron law of governing. It doesn't matter what a person's job title is, it is what proximity they have to the centre of power. Bannon was on the outside, but he was still a source of counsel. Now he is not just on the outside, he is in outer darkness.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency\n\nSo what is Steve Bannon's next move? Well I make one confident prediction: it won't be to roll up his tent, pack his knapsack and skulk away with his head drooping. Bannon is campaigning to tear down the Republican establishment, and in Breitbart News he has a fairly formidable weapon with which to wage his war. Bannon wants candidates in this year's mid term election who will threaten the existing Republican leadership, who will follow the populist, nationalist policies that led Donald Trump to election victory in 2016. You have two men now violently fighting it out for the hearts and minds of the Americans who propelled Donald Trump to victory.\n\nWhen I came to work this morning I thought nothing would or could eclipse Donald Trump's tweet about Kim Jong-un. But now it seems that Mr Bannon and President Trump are locked in a battle over who's got the bigger button and whose is most powerful.\n\nNext move, Steve Bannon. And this is so much less life-threatening than real nuclear war.Pike's films include Gone Girl, Die Another Day, Made in Dagenham and Jack Reacher\n\nGone Girl actress Rosamund Pike says there won't be more female leading roles in Hollywood movies until male stars change their attitude.\n\n\"Male actors now have to decide that they are willing to play supporting roles to female leads,\" Pike said.\n\n\"And often it seems men don't want to,\" she told Radio 4's Film Programme.\n\n\"They're more than happy to play a supporting role to Christian Bale - another man - (but) less happy to play supporting roles to a lead woman.\"\n\nPike is starring in gritty Western Hostiles with Bale, which is released in the UK on Friday.\n\nBale will next play former vice president Dick Cheney in the biopic, Backseat\n\nPike continued: \"Many, many actors are coming out saying we want more female-driven stories, we want fantastic roles for women... so the next consequence is, if you want those to come, then the boys have to play second fiddle.\n\n\"That's just the way it is. Until that happens, there will be fewer films with female leads made,\" she added.\n\nFilms with leading female stars and supporting male actors are not as common as the other way round.\n\nBut there are some well-known examples, including 2013's Oscar-winning film Gravity, with Sandra Bullock playing the lead alongside George Clooney, and sci-fi flick Arrival (2016), with Jeremy Renner in a supporting role alongside Amy Adams.\n\nA 2016 study suggested that inequality is \"entrenched\" in Hollywood, with women, minorities and LGBT people among those excluded.\n\nThe University of Southern California's report showed that women had just 31.4% of spoken roles in 2015's top 100 films, compared with 32.8% in 2008.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

This is a situation that should have hit the headlines because there's people sleeping in bus shelters.\"\n\nMr Dudley described street begging in the town as creating a \"hostile atmosphere\" for both residents and tourists in a letter to Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfeld.\n\nMr Stansfeld said many of the people on the streets of Windsor were \"very vulnerable and have mental health issues\".\n\n\"It's not as easy as putting them in a police van and dumping them in Southall or somewhere. It's much more complicated than that,\" he said.\n\nThe Rev Louise Brown, a vicar in nearby Dedworth, said no beggars had ever been aggressive to her in Windsor when she had spoken to them.\n\nShe said: \"Yes some of them have got drink problems, but without support from the council to find real solutions I think the problem is going to be there.\n\n\"You can't just sweep it away because it's a royal town.\"\n\nThe couple will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in May\n\nEight people were sleeping rough in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead at the last official count in 2016, according to government statistics.", "t have been dealt with.\"\n\n\"How can I hit my child and then tell him it's wrong to hit his brother?\n\n\"I would never want that reign of terror in my house to be honest.\"\n\nPhyllis Preece, mother of two and chairwoman of the National Pensioners Convention for Wales, disagreed: \"It didn't do my sister or I any harm to have a smack and exactly the same with my two children.

When the turkey's gone cold and the evening's drawn in, it's the Trivial Pursuit board which often comes out.\n\nAnd it was a \"newish\" Christmas gift of the popular board game from his nephew which prompted John Lewis, 47, to share a picture of the game on social media that has subsequently been shared thousands of times.\n\nLewis - not the department store, not the US man who is frequently mistaken for a department store on Twitter, but a journalist and editor from London - was playing the Family Edition of the game on Tuesday when his daughter discovered an unusual error.\n\nReading a question about 2008 film Australia, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, Lewis' daughter was baffled. A mysterious 'Hugh Jackilometresan' appeared to have supplanted Jackman as the film's leading man.\n\n\"She showed us the card and we all found it hilarious,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"As an editor, I also immediately guessed how it had happened.\"\n\nLewis is not the first social media user to spot the error. @JackStooks and others noticed the problem back in 2015.\n\nLewis believes that the error could have been caused by a \"cavalier find-and-replace command\" where 'km' had been substituted for 'kilometres' by the game's makers. Hasbro has been approached for comment.\n\nAnd he says that was not the only example he spotted.\n\n\"There is another error I later found in the same pack,\" he said, \"where 'kg' has been universally replaced to 'kilograms'.\n\n\"So the question reads: 'What U2 song plays in the 'backilogramsound' of the famous Friends episode where Ross tries to get Rachel back after they were on a break?\"\n\nLewis shared his image on Facebook and Twitter, where his post has attracted thousands of retweets and likes.\n\n\"I don't even use Twitter that much,\" he said. \"But this Trivial Pursuit tweet has had something ridiculous like 8,000 likes and more than 5,000 retweets in the last 36 hours.\"Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nBritish number one Johanna Konta continued her good start to 2017 by reaching the semi-finals of the Shenzhen Open in China.\n\nThe world number 10 defeated Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic, ranked 60th, 6-4 6-7 (11-13) 6-3.\n\nHer next opponent will be another Czech, Katerina Siniakova, who beat Serbian Nina Stojanovic 6-3 6-4.\n\nKonta is now the highest-ranked player left in the event after world number three Agnieszka Radwanska's exit.\n\nThe Polish top seed was beaten 6-2 3-6 6-0 by American world number 39 Alison Riske, who will face Camila Giorgi of Italy in the last four.\n\nKonta looked in control early on against her opponent - the twin sister of world number six Karolina Pliskova - as she took the first set with a single break of serve.\n\nNeither player could force a break point in the second set and in the resulting tie-break Konta wasted two match points before the big-serving Pliskova levelled the match on her fifth set point.\n\nBut Konta stayed firm in the final set, claiming the break and reaching the semi-final on her fifth match point.\n\n\"I am very happy to have extended my stay here,\" she said.\n\n\"She is one of the best servers on tour so I knew I was going to have a hard time on her service games.

They are a top, top side, probably the best side I've seen live.\n\n\"They have so many players that are intricate and have class on the ball and sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say 'they are a better side than us'.\n\n\"But the spirit we showed, we never gave in and we continued to try and attack and scored two goals and not many teams can score two goals against a side like that.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: \"We are so happy to be there, to reach this final.

In the video released by the YPG a man with an American accent is heard saying they are prepared to fight\n\nBritish men are among a group of international volunteers preparing to fight against Turkish-led forces in north-west Syria, the BBC understands.\n\nThey have joined the Kurdish militia, the YPG, to fight the Turkish offensive on the Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin.\n\nAmong the volunteers is a 24-year-old British-Chinese fighter from Manchester, known as Huang Lei.\n\nLei, who originally travelled to Syria in 2015 to battle against IS, told the BBC it was his \"duty\" to fight.\n\nThe YPG has released a video showing an international group of volunteers who previously fought in Syria against so-called Islamic State.\n\nLei has told the BBC that there are two other Britons with him among the group, although they have chosen to remain anonymous.\n\nIn the video, an American says: \"We're all ready to go and fight in Afrin, against the invading force of Turkey.\n\n\"We've been training for a significant amount of time. We are prepared, and we have been supplied by the YPG to fight against the Turkish terrorists.\"\n\nHuang Lei was a student studying international politics at the University of Manchester when he travelled to Syria in 2015\n\n\"We were fighting against ISIS in Syria and suddenly we heard that Turkey is attacking Afrin and bombing the city,\" he says.\n\n\"We want to go there to help people defend the city and protect the people.\"\n\nHuang Lei, pictured with another fighter, says there is now a group of around 20 international volunteers preparing to fight against Turkish-led forces\n\nThis marks a significant shift in the involvement of international fighters in the Syrian war.\n\nWith the IS threat diminished, for some volunteers their mission has changed.\n\nYPG fighters have been seen to the north-east of Afrin\n\n\"Defending Afrin is our duty,\" says Lei, who was a student studying international politics at the University of Manchester when he travelled to Syria in 20", "with more \"chromosomal chaos\" - the ability to readily reshuffle large amounts of their DNA to alter thousands of genetic instructions - were those most likely to come back.\n\nProf Charles Swanton, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"You've got a system in place where a cancer cell can alter its behaviour very rapidly by gaining or losing whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes.\n\n\"It is evolution on steroids.\"\n\nThat allows the tumour to develop resistance to drugs, the ability to hide from the immune system or the skills to move to other tissues in the body.\n\nThe first implication of the research is for drug development - by understanding the key role of chromosomal instability, scientists can find ways to stop it.\n\nProf Swanton told me: \"I hope we'll be able to generate new approaches to limit it and bring evolution back from the brink, perhaps reduce the evolutionary capacity of tumours and hopefully stop them adapting.\n\nThe scientists say they are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved by analysing the DNA of cancers.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Bridge designer Ian Firth and engineering expert Dave Parker on whether a bridge is feasible.\n\nDowning Street has said there are \"no specific plans\" for a bridge between the UK and France after Boris Johnson floated the idea of a \"fixed link\".\n\nThe UK foreign secretary reportedly ran the idea past French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit on Thursday.\n\nBut Downing Street said he had been referring to a panel looking at Anglo-French major projects.\n\nExperts said a bridge was technically possible but some critics ridiculed the concept.\n\nThursday's summit with Prime Minister Theresa May at Sandhurst's Royal Military Academy in Berkshire was Emmanuel Macron's first UK visit since becoming French president.\n\nThe BBC understands Mr Johnson made the comments while discussing other major infrastructure projects around the world, including a bridge in Japan.\n\nMr Johnson said in a tweet that the UK and France had agreed that a panel of experts should be assigned to look at \"major projects\".\n\nA source close to the foreign secretary said he also thought it was \"crazy\" the two countries were only connected by one railway line when they were merely 20 miles apart.\n\nAsked about the remarks, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I haven't seen any plans on that. We are going to have very close ties with France economically, culturally and in areas such as defence and security for many many decades to come.\n\n\"What was agreed yesterday (Thursday) and what the foreign secretary tweeted about as well is a panel of experts who will look at major projects together, including infrastructure. And we want to work very closely with our French colleagues on building a shared, prosperous future.\"\n\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd, on a visit to Crawley, West Sussex, was more forthright: \"I think I'm safe saying that I am not a huge fan of this latest proposal.\"\n\nA spokesman for the French president confirmed he had had a conversation with Mr Johnson about a bridge and said Mr Macron had told him: \"The issue of access is an important one.\" But he denied reports the French president had responded with \"I agree, let's do it\".\n\nIt is not the first time the idea of a Channel bridge has been raised - transport officials submitted plans for one in 1981.\n\nThe proposals were dismissed as \"impractical\" at the time, as it would make it difficult for ships to navigate the waters.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, bridge designer and former president of the Institution of Structural Engineers Ian Firth said it would be a \"huge undertaking, but absolutely possible\".\n\nBut the idea was greeted with scepticism on social media. Labour's Emily Thornberry tweeted that she had assumed it was \"not real\".\n\nBoris Buses: As mayor of London, Mr Johnson launched a competition in 2008 to design a new London bus to replace the iconic Routemaster. They hit the roads in 2012 but faced criticism over their cost, problems with their hybrid engines and non-opening windows. Transport for London have said they are not buying any more.\n\nEmirates Air Line: The \u00a360m cable car over the Thames near the O2 Arena opened ahead of the London Olympics in 2012, again during Mr Johnson's tenure as London mayor. He said it was an ideal way of linking north and south London but it faced criticism over its cost and limited passenger numbers.\n\nBoris Island: Long backed by Mr Johnson as an alternative way of expanding airport provision in south-east England, the \u00a347bn plan for an island airport in the Thames Estuary was rejected as an option by the commission looking into the issue in 2014. He had argued it could \"reshape the economic geography\" of south-east England.\n\nGarden Bridge: A \u00a3200m plan, backed by Mr Johnson, to build a bridge covered with trees over the River Thames in central London was abandoned last year, having lost the support of his successor as mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan.\n\nDover MP Charlie Elphicke backed Mr Johnson's idea, saying: \"Boris is right. We absolutely must invest in infrastructure to keep trade flowing between Britain and France.\" But former UKIP Nigel Farage told the BBC that the idea sounded like \"a big waste of money\".\n\nFormer Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the idea was \"a masterstroke in diversion\".\n\n\"It's all very well talking about a bridge that may or may not be built in decades to come. The thing that worries me much more is he wants to pull up the drawbridge to the economic relationship which has served us so well over such a long period of time.\"\n\nConservative MP Mark Pritchard was not a fan of the idea, tweeting it was \"a bridge too far\":\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

One boy had been circumcised and was living with an untreated, painful infection.\n\nMany of the other children also had skin infections which they say weren't being treated.\n\nFollowing the raid all the children were returned to their families.\n\nA government social worker, Maria Nagawa, said conditions there were the worst she had ever seen.\n\nSocial workers found tools, including an axe, lying of the floor of the orphanage\n\nIn Masaka, the BBC also met a woman called Laetitia - not her real name - who is a mother of six children.\n\nAfter her husband died, she was struggling to raise money for her children's school fees when she was approached by a woman working for the orphanage in 2016.\n\nLaetitia was persuaded to send her two youngest boys, then aged 7 and 5, to the home, where she was promised they would be given a top education.\n\nLast spring, the boys were returned home by social workers who were concerned about their living conditions.\n\nThe eldest of the pair, now aged 9, told the BBC how his brother was beaten if he wet his bed.\n\n\"Whenever I tried to go and help him out, they would also beat me,\" he added.\n\nBoth boys said beatings were common at the home and that they even saw female members of staff melting plastic bags and using them to burn the children.\n\nLaeticia says her eldest son also contracted typhoid from dirty drinking water at the orphanage.\n\nA government social worker said conditions there were the worst she had seen\n\nA Facebook group for the home, regularly updated with posts by Mr Oldham is called \"Rock of Joy children's care\".\n\nThe BBC investigation found that money was fraudulently raised for the home using the credentials of a charity with a similar name - The Rock of Joy Trust, also based in the North West.\n\nThe charity also operates in Uganda.\n\nThe founders of the genuine Rock of Joy Trust said the fact their name was being used in connection to the illegal orphanage was appalling and extremely upsetting.\n\nA response on behalf of Mr Oldham said: \"Any personal allegations are refuted, we are considering the possibility of legal action.\n\n\"It is our understanding that some children remain and it is paramount that we both protect and secure their future.\"\n\nAn open pit latrine toilet flooded the floor outside the building\n\nThe permanent secretary of the Ugandan ministry responsible for children Pius Bigirimana warned UK donors against giving money to orphanages without official checks.\n\nHe said: \"If you are interested in supporting these children, don't just go put money into a home which is unlisted.\n\n\"Why don't you assist the family to look after the children instead of looking at an institution?\"\n\nThe UK charity Hope and Homes for Children is assisting the Ugandan government in its work to keep children in their families, rather than living in institutions.\n\nIts chief executive, Mark Waddington said the number of children living in orphanages in Uganda had grown from just under 2,000 in the 1990's to more than 55,000.\n\nHe said orphanages were now seen as \"an economy\".\n\n\"We are seeing children being conned out of households, with their parents being persuaded under the offer of a Western style education,\" he said.\n\n\"They are used literally as commodities to raise funding.\"\n\nListen to the full File on 4 report, called The Orphanage Business, here.\n\u2022 None 'They told me I'd given up rights to my son'A driver who witnessed the aftermath of a crash involving the Duke of Edinburgh has told how many motorists stopped to help at the scene.\n\nNick Cobb said up to eight cars pulled up on the A149, near the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, after the crash at about 15:00 GMT.\n\nHe said a \"lot of people\" were \"milling round and helping.\"\n\nPrince Philip, 97, was not injured in the accident.\n\nThe other car involved was a Kia.

A sketch of the suspect is expected to be released as early as Thursday.\n\n\"We will not rest until an arrest is made. We are going to continue to search for this killer,\" he said at a news conference.\n\nMs Washington, 30, was shot in the arm during the attack and her six-year-old daughter was injured by the broken glass.\n\nFrom her hospital bed, Ms Washington tearfully told KHOU 11 News: \"I replayed this moment in my head over a million times to see - did I cut this man off?\n\n\"Did I make a wrong turn in front of him?\"\n\n\"Did I do anything wrong to cause this man to fire shots at my car? I didn't.\n\n\"I didn't do anything. He fired off at us for no reason.\"\n\nPolice have urged anyone with information to come forward, asking locals to review security camera footage in their homes or businesses to help track down the gunman.\n\n\"Yes, we know we're in Texas. Yes, we know we have a lot of pickup trucks out there,\" Mr Gonzalez said during a news conference on Monday.\n\n\"But when you put the pieces together, consider that we're looking for a bearded man, possibly in his 40s, driving a red pickup truck. This could be your neighbour. This could be your co-worker.\"\n\nHe also called on the gunman to turn himself in to avoid any further violence.\n\nSeven-year-old Jazmine Barnes was in the second grade\n\n\"What if that was your daughter?\" he said. \"Please step up at this point in time and help me and my family get justice for my baby girl.\"\n\nThe images of the pickup truck have been widely shared online as the manhunt continues.\n\nAva DuVernay, director of films Selma and A Wrinkle in Time, was one of the many voices on social media calling for the gunman's capture, sharing the family's story in a tweet.\n\nActresses Sophia Bush and Gabrielle Union have also both spoken out online.\n\nThis Instagram post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas\n\nNext has reported a sharp rise in online sales over the Christmas period, while trading at its stores declined.\n\nThe retailer said strong sales during the three weeks prior to Christmas and the October half-term holiday had made up for a \"disappointing\" November.\n\nIn a continuation of recent trends, online sales rose 15.2% between 28 October and 29 December from a year earlier, while store sales fell 9.2%.\n\nIn total, full-price sales at the retailer were up 1.5% over the period.\n\nThe retailer expects an annual profit of \u00a3723m, slightly lower than its previous forecast of \u00a3727m.\n\nIt blamed the lower forecast on strong sales of less profitable items such as beauty products and personalised gifts.\n\nThe company said it was particularly difficult to forecast how its business would perform this year, due to the uncertainty around the UK's upcoming departure from the European Union.\n\n\"People are maybe a little bit more cautious, given the uncertainties around Brexit. But I think that's as strong as you can put it,\" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit.\n\nAt the moment, Next assumes economic conditions this year will be", "your friends.\n\nI was tempted to go for Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois for another clean sheet. His save from Hull's Oumar Niasse in the closing minutes nearly clinched it, but I have gone for Petr Cech. The former Chelsea keeper was first class throughout the messy affair. He took a blow to the head that caused a moment's concern but recovered to put in a solid performance against a very dangerous Burnley.\n\nYou can count on Cech to be professional in a crisis and there were times in this match when Arsenal seemed to be out of control. The behaviour of Arsene Wenger was jaw-dropping. To push the fourth official, who was well within his rights to ask Wenger to leave the area having been dismissed, was appalling. It's just as well the Arsenal manager has apologised to him, it's the least he could do. Now he will have to wait to hear what the FA thought about this unseemly affair. I suspect it won't be good.\n\nWhat a finish by Seamus Coleman. If there is one full-back you want the ball to drop to in the opposition's penalty area minutes from time then Coleman's the man. Palace can moan all they want about Jeffrey Schlupp requiring treatment for cramp. The referee is under no obligation to stop the match unless he considers the matter serious. For Everton - and Coleman in particular - to take advantage of Palace's misfortune is precisely what the game is all about.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, Coleman was superb all afternoon. He was a constant menace down Crystal Palace's left side and caused all sorts of problems for the Eagles. Time is running out for Sam Allardyce. Having suffered that earth-shattering experience of losing the England job in such an undignified fashion, I wondered if it has destroyed what has hitherto been an impregnable confidence? I hope not because Palace are going to need it.\n\nTrying to win a football match with 10 men is one thing - but it becomes considerably more difficult when your manager and team-mates seem to have lost the plot while you are trying to do it. That's what appeared to be the situation facing Shkodran Mustafi in a mad spell at Emirates Stadium. It all started when Granit Xhaka made a totally outrageous tackle on Steven Defour, followed by an equally needless challenge by Francis Coquelin that resulted in a penalty.\n\nThe madness didn't stop there either; Arsene Wenger was then removed from the dugout for remonstrating about a decision the referee Jon Moss got absolutely right. Fortunately, Mustafi kept his cool at a time when all around him were losing theirs.\n\nThis was not an easy game for Chelsea or Gary Cahill but they both got through it. The Chelsea captain suffered a nasty bang on the head having clashed with Ryan Mason. Mason never recovered and went straight to hospital, while Cahill went on to score the goal that sealed a difficult victory. The Blues have now stretched their lead at the top of the table, having kept their discipline and their composure.\n\nNotably, we saw the return of Diego Costa from the naughty corner, adding his goalscoring talents to the side. No doubt Cahill read Costa the riot act on behalf of the players and dressing room order seems to have been restored. Now they go to Liverpool in two weeks' time with an opportunity to put this title race beyond the Merseysiders. It's amazing what a team can achieve with discipline, talent and composure.\n\nWhat a strike by Chris Brunt. We know the Northern Irishman can whack a ball, but his goal against Sunderland was so sweetly struck that it was an object of sheer beauty. What was not so pretty was the altercation between Darren Fletcher and Papy Djilobodji when the Senegal defender appeared to shove the West Brom captain in the face. Based on the evidence, no punches were thrown - but hands were certainly raised.\n\nWhy West Brom manager Tony Pulis, in his post-match interview, devolved his 'opinion' to the MOTD studio on this specific matter I don't really understand. Managers can seriously defend a player's actions or condemn them - Pulis elected to do neither. I hope we are not coming into a period in the game where managers (Pep Guardiola included) no longer think it their job to express an opinion. However, there was one thing we all agreed on: Brunt's goal was a cracker.\n\nThe penalty that settled this fixture was controversial but it took a big man to convert it. Once I saw Alexis Sanchez step up to the spot I knew the game was over. The fact Jon Moss got the decision wrong in my view is immaterial now, but what did the referee think Ben Mee was going to do, let Laurent Koscielny head the ball into the back of the net?\n\nThe defender is entitled to clear the ball regardless of where the opposing player is prepared to stick his head. Nevertheless, the penalty was awarded and Sanchez showed his class with a coolly taken spot-kick in a white hot atmosphere. It's just as well Arsenal have a player who in this sort of situation can cope with the pressure.\n\nThe former Tottenham midfielder gave Liverpool fair warning early in the first half when he hit the woodwork. However, it was the way this young talent seemed to run the show that impressed me. He spent long periods dictating the play - irrespective of the presence of Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum - and did so with real purpose. Swansea's first league win at Anfield was masterminded by a 24-year-old who did not have much Premier League experience.\n\nLast week, we saw Liverpool defend heroically at Old Trafford - but courage alone is not enough. Liverpool need know-how and a central defender who can organise and marshal his defensive colleagues in isolation and one that doesn't need the assistance of the cavalry every time there is a set-piece or counter-attack. The Reds now have to face Chelsea, Spurs and Arsenal at Anfield in a matter of weeks. I keep saying that Liverpool can't win the title with this defence, but it's obvious Jurgen Klopp disagrees.\n\nHe's only gone and done it. Wayne Rooney has broken Sir Bobby Charlton's record and Bobby was there to see it. 250 not out. It was a landmark goal by the best team player of his generation. Rooney was so consumed in his post-match interview by the fact that Manchester United had salvaged a point in such difficult circumstances that his record-breaking exploit had become secondary.\n\nThis typified a player who I have grown to greatly respect over the years. He never misses an England match if called upon and plays for his club in any position when required. Rooney stood up to Sir Alex Ferguson (and quite rightly) when he felt his manager wasn't buying the players befitting of Manchester United, prolonged David Moyes' tenure at the club with virtuoso performances having been told he was surplus to requirements - and now sits on the bench without a moment's fuss or hesitation under Jose Mourinho, waiting to come to the rescue if needed. This is a player who deserves all the plaudits. After all, he's earned them.\n\nThis was a game in which Leicester City were unrecognisable from the side who won the Premier League title. Admittedly, Southampton and James Ward-Prowse in particular contributed to their demise, but I must say the Foxes are playing with fire. Better teams than them have gone down and Claudio Ranieri had better pull his finger out.\n\nIn the meantime, Southampton have worked their way through a very difficult period and as a result unearthed a new Morgan Schneiderlin. Every time I see Ward-Prowse play, he gets better and better and he was the architect of Leicester's downfall. That said, if Leicester are serious about staying in the Premier League, they should seriously consider how they manage their Champions League fixtures because they can't succeed in both.\n\nCrisis, what crisis? I said last week if Andy Carroll can stay fit between now and the end of the season, Dimitri Payet can take a running jump. In fact, I will drive him to Marseille myself.\n\nThe former Liverpool and Newcastle striker looks in great form at the moment and destroyed Middlesbrough, who seem to be punching above their weight. I have an enormous amount of time for manager Aitor Karanka's team, who remind me a bit of Jack Charlton's Boro in the 70s. There wasn't a great deal of stardom in that side either but tremend", "ies to help, but it was six o'clock in the morning and none of my volunteers were answering.\n\nI was able to sucker one of the local cops into trying to help me, but he didn't want to put his hands around the alligator's mouth, which is understandable.\n\nAnother way to catch an alligator is to try to outweigh them by jumping on their back, so I talked this poor cop into jumping on to the back of this alligator with me.\n\nThe trick is you put all your weight down and sit completely down on the alligator. Well, the officer didn't and he kind of just danced around the alligator which any untrained person probably would.\n\nThe alligator didn't like that, so he started wiggling around, trying to get away. I knew instantly this was not going to work, so I stood up to back off and the alligator swatted me with his tail and made me fall on my bottom right there beside his un-taped mouth.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Christy Kroboth and police officer in action in the car park\n\nWe were all worn out from trying to catch this alligator for four hours, the parking lot was getting busy and stores were starting to open so I had to make the decision to call in a game warden.\n\nI got very sad because game wardens usually don't come out and catch alligators, game wardens usually come out and kill alligators.\n\nI went to my car and I started crying because I'd been defeated by this animal. I called the game warden and he said, \"Christy, stop crying. I am going to come help you. Do not touch that alligator until I get there.\"\n\nWell, when he said that I just got so much energy, I was so happy. I got out of my car like I could just conquer the world because somebody was coming to help me.\n\nSomehow I was able to go up to the alligator and hold his jaws in my arm and tape his mouth shut with my right hand. We ran to Home Depot and got zip ties to tie the alligator's hands behind his back like he was in handcuffs so he couldn't walk off.\n\nThen the game warden showed up and he said, \"I told you not to catch him!\"\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry, I just had all this confidence and I was able to do it!\"\n\nWe had to borrow a forklift to pick the alligator up and load him in to my buddy's truck, because he was so big.\n\nPotentially dangerous alligators that cannot be released back into the wild are taken to a farm with tons of acreage and tons of ponds. But if the alligator can be released in the wild we have certain release sites where we can drop them off.\n\nI have an SUV and sometimes the smaller alligators will want to climb over the seats and try to make their way to the front to help me drive, so it's me and the alligator waving at people going down the freeways.\n\nI've found out if you make it freezing cold in your car the alligators are calmer. So although it's the middle of summertime here in Houston - 97F (36C), humidity - I'm on the freeway in a jacket with gloves and a scarf and a blanket wrapped around me because my car is freezing cold.\n\nBut the alligator is behaving, so that's all that matters.\n\nSometimes they go to the bathroom, and alligator poo is not that great, so we'll have to roll down the windows and travel on down the road.\n\nBeing the animal lover I am I think it's very important that we educate everybody on the animals that are living in their backyards and help them understand that we can all live together.\n\nI have three educational alligators, their names are Cam, Taylor and Halo. We call them our \"edugators\" because we take them to schools and we teach people alligator safety and alligator education.\n\nI work with these alligators every single day, they're used to being handled so they don't see us as a threat. They'll even sit on the couch and watch TV with me when they're not in their enclosures.\n\nWhen I go out on a catch sometimes there's a very afraid person there whose mindset is changed. They may say, \"Oh, I understand his importance now, I like him, let's name him.\" When I see that change in people that's what really drives me to do what I do.\n\nThat's why I wake up and why I do my job every single day.\n\nListen to Christy Kroboth speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nHull City midfielder Ryan Mason is conscious and has been speaking about the incident in which he fractured his skull during Sunday's game at Chelsea, the club said in a statement.\n\nMason, 25, clashed heads with Blues defender Gary Cahill 13 minutes into the Premier League match.\n\nHe was taken to St Mary's Hospital in London, where he had surgery.\n\n\"Ryan and his family have been extremely touched by the overwhelming support,\" added the statement.\n\n\"They would very much like to thank all of those who have posted such positive comments both on social media and in the press over the last 24 hours.\"\n\nHull added Mason would continue to be monitored at the hospital \"over the coming days\".\n\nTigers captain Michael Dawson, club doctor Mark Waller, head of medical Rob Price and club secretary Matt Wild visited Mason in hospital on Monday.\n\nCahill, Chelsea captain John Terry and assistant manager Steve Holland had visited on Sunday to check on Mason's well-being, and spent time with his family.\n\nMason, Hull's record signing, fractured his skull as he attempted to head the ball clear of his own box following a cross from Pedro.\n\nHe got to the ball a split second before Cahill, who was already committed to his attempted header, and the pair collided.\n\nBoth players spent a lengthy period receiving treatment, though Cahill was able to continue.\n\nMason joined Hull from Tottenham last August for a club-record undisclosed fee.\n\nHe has scored one goal in 16 Premier League appearances for the Tigers.\n\nPrior to his move, he made 53 top-flight appearances for Tottenham, and had loan spells at Yeovil, Doncaster, Millwall, Lorient and Swindon.\n\nHull lost Sunday's game 2-0 as goals from Diego Costa and Cahill gave Chelsea a victory that took them eight points clear at the top.\n\nHead traumas and the damage they can cause\n\nWhen head trauma happens, doctors are obviously concerned about how much damage there might be to the brain.\n\nSome skull fractures need little or no treatment and will heal by themselves with time. Others need urgent treatment.\n\nAny bits of bone that have been pressed inwards can be removed and returned to their correct position. If necessary, metal wire or mesh may be used to reconnect the pieces.\n\nOnce the bone is back in place, it should heal.\n\n'Lessons appear to have been learned'\n\nPeter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury association Headway, said the reaction of the medical teams was \"exemplary\".\n\nMcCabe, who was at Stamford Bridge, added: \"Headway has been critical of the way in which head injuries have been treated in many high-profile football incidents in recent years, but it is positive to see that lessons appear to have been learned.\"Chelsea beat struggling Hull 2-0 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points. Arsenal were the only other team in the top six to win, beating Burnley 2-1.\n\nManchester City and Tottenham drew 2-2 on Saturday, while Wayne Rooney scored a record 250th Manchester United goal as they rescued a point at Stoke.\n\nElsewhere, there were wins for Southampton against Leicester, Swansea against Liverpool, Everton at Crystal Palace, West Ham at Middlesbrough and West Brom against Sunderland.

That's a reasonable measure of how busy the NHS is, but other measures suggest different days were busier.\n\nSecretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt made the claim on BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he thanked staff for their work over Christmas.\n\nNHS England publishes daily statistics during the winter for several metrics to do with NHS services, so we can look into whether it is the case.\n\nWe can assume he was talking about the NHS in England only, because health is devolved, so he is not in charge of the NHS in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nThe number of people attending accident and emergency departments is an important indicator of demand for hospital services.\n\nOn 27 December, there were 60,215 attendances at A&E departments.\n\nThat is a high level, but it's not the highest for the month, which was set at 60,692 on 5 December.\n\nBut it turns out that Mr Hunt was talking about only type-one A&E departments, which is what most people would think of as an A&E department.\n\nType-two are specialist units, such as Moorfields Eye Unit, while type-three are GP-led walk-in centres.\n\nThere were 46,315 attendances at type-one A&E departments, which is the highest of the month. Comparisons with previous years are difficult due to changes in coverage and figures not being broken down in the same way.\n\nAnother important measure is the number of emergency admissions, which was 13,715 on 27 December.\n\nThat is a high figure, but the number was higher on each of the following three days - it was 14,649 on 28 December.\n\nLooking at the proportion of beds occupied: on 27 December, 90.5% of the total number of available beds were occupied.\n\nThat's actually quite low by the standards of last month - there were higher figures on 24 days in December.\n\nNHS England says that the week ending 1 January 2017 was the busiest week for the NHS 111 24-hour non-emergency service since it began in August 2010, but we do not get that figure broken down by day so cannot say whether the Tuesday was the busiest day.\n\nWe also do not have daily figures for how busy other parts of the NHS were, such as GPs.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, insisting the change was based on \"sporting merit\" and not to make money.\n\nThe sport's world governing body voted unanimously in favour of the change at a meeting in Zurich on Tuesday.\n\nCampaign group New Fifa Now described the expansion as \"a money grab and power grab\".\n\nBut Infantino told the BBC: \"It is the opposite, it's a football decision.\"\n\nHe added: \"Every format has advantages in financial terms. We were in a comfortable situation to take a decision based on sporting merit.\"\n\nAn initial stage of 16 groups of three teams will precede a knockout stage for the remaining 32 with the change coming in for the 2026 tournament.\n\nAccording to Fifa research, revenue is predicted to increase to \u00a35.29bn for a 48-team tournament, giving a potential profit rise of \u00a3521m.\n\n\"This is a historic decision which marks the entrance of the World Cup into the 21st Century,\" added Infantino.\n\nThe Football Association has urged Fifa to consider the needs of fans, players, teams and leagues and asked for more information on how the tournament would work, with Infantino admitting much of the detail has yet to be worked out.\n\nThe European Club Association (ECA), which represents the interests of clubs at European level, reiterated it was against expansion. It said Fifa had made a political rather than a sporting decision.\n\nNew Fifa Now says the governing body needs to reform, and that the change would \"dilute the competitiveness of the tournament\".\n\nInfantino, however, maintains the expansion will increase the quality of the teams in the competition.\n\n\"Costa Rica eliminated England and Italy in the last World Cup, a good solid team and there are many other teams who could make it to the World Cup,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe that the actual quality could rise, because many more countries will have the chance to qualify so they will invest in their elite football as well as grassroots.\"\n\nResponding to criticism from European clubs, Infantino added: \"The game has changed. Football has now become a truly global game. Everyone is happy about investment in Europe, but what about helping outside Europe? They need to be open.\n\n\"The key message from clubs I appreciate fully has always been don't touch the calendar, the dates of the World Cup or the burden for the players, and both these commissions fulfil them.\n\n\"We will play 32 days like now, we play maximum seven matches like now, 12 stadiums, like now, but give the chance for more countries to dream.\"\n\nHow it would work?\n\nThe number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games.\n\nThe tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule.\n\nThe changes mark the first World Cup expansion since 1998.\n\nInfantino said the decision on who will get the extra qualification slots has yet to be made but \"this will be looked at speedily\", adding: \"The only sure thing is that everyone will have a bit more representation than they have.\"\n\nThe president said he believed the World Cup could emulate what he felt was a successful Euro 2016 tournament, where the number of teams taking part was similarly increased.\n\nQualifying for last year's tournament featured a record 53 nations, while the number of teams at the finals increased from 16 to 24.\n\n\"It was the most interesting in the history of the European Championship,\" said Infantino.\n\n\"All the other teams started to believe in their chance to qualify and play matches with a different mindset that they could qualify.\n\n\"We saw Wales, Iceland, Northern Ireland qualify, some for the first time, some for first time in many years. The Netherlands always qualify, but they didn't. Qualifying created a whole new dynamic and hopefully we will do the same.\"We take it for granted that our children will be better off than us but the so-called millennials - anyone born in the 1980s or 1990s - could become the first generation to earn less than their parents.\n\nAnd are those parents, mostly baby boomers who benefited from economic good times, tax cuts and free higher education to blame?\n\nBaby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1965, will on average earn \u00a374", "Clearly, to deploy 150 officers shows how seriously we take this.\n\n\"Human trafficking, the exploitation of the most vulnerable in our communities by the most ruthless, will not be accepted.\n\n\"To those who traffic in human beings, in human lives, who seek to gain from fear or weakness, our message is unequivocal; we are strong, we are determined and we will bring you to justice.\"\n\nResidential and business addresses were targeted in the raids\n\nACC Harwin said the force had received intelligence that an unknown number of young women had been trafficked within the Cleveland force area for the purposes of sex over a number of months.\n\nReports said victims were raped by multiple men after being driven to residential addresses.\n\nHe said he was unable to give exact victim numbers at this time, or to say if any of them were juveniles.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Nico died in his sleep on 7 January\n\nOne of the world's oldest silverback gorillas has died at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire.\n\nNico, 56, died in his sleep on 7 January and staff at the park say they are \"truly saddened\".\n\nA spokesman said: \"It is with deep regret and huge sadness that we have to announce the death of Nico, our much-loved western lowland gorilla.\"\n\n\"My first memory was having a cup of tea with him,\" he said, explaining that it is important to build up a relationship with gorillas to gain their trust.\n\nWhen Nico arrived in England he had to be quarantined in his enclosure for six months. During that time he displayed signs of boredom, so his keepers gave him a television to keep him entertained.\n\nWhen they tried to take the television away, Mr Turner said \"all hell broke loose,\" so it was swiftly returned.\n\nNico kept the television for the rest of his life and particularly enjoyed watching nature documentaries, Mr Turner said..\n\nTV company Sky even tried to make Nico a bespoke remote control, but it turned out not to be \"gorilla-proof\".\n\nNico had a reputation for looking grumpy but his expression signified contentment, his keepers said\n\nNico's partner, Samba, died 10 years ago and Mr Turner said the silverback was \"sad when she went\".\n\nHowever, the pair had a \"brother and sister relationship\" and never bred.\n\nAfter Samba's death, Nico lived alone at the park, which is natural behaviour for adult male gorillas in the wild.\n\nLongleat said that attempting to mix him again would have been like putting a \"granddad with boisterous teenagers\".\n\nSilverback gorillas in the wild are used to being on their own\n\nGorillas usually live between 30 and 40 years in the wild and Longleat said it was \"quite astonishing\" for Nico, who weighed about 170kgs and was 5'10 tall, to reach the age of 56.\n\nBut he was \"slowing down\" and his keepers noticed something was wrong when he gradually stopped eating as much as usual.\n\n\"It had been a rough winter for him,\" said Mr Turner.\n\nHe said losing Nico was like \"losing a member of the family\".\n\nOn his 56th birthday last July, Nico's keepers gave him a cake made from bananas and courgettes with carrot candles.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.A French publisher aims to install machines, which print stories and poems on demand, in unexpected places.\n\nShort Edition is promoting its dispenser at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe BBC's Chris Foxx challenged the entrepreneur involved about whether the scheme had a hope of success in the age of the smartphone.\n\nRead and watch all our coverage from CESThe worst is yet to come for diesel cars which will see their sales continue to plunge, a study has warned.\n\nAston University predicts they will account for just 15% of the UK market by 2025, down from a 50% peak.\n\nAutomotive expert Professor David Bailey said diesel's \"slow death\" was being driven by \"environmental pressures and consumer confusion\" .\n\nHe is urging the government to set up a scrappage scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric cars.\n\n\"The time is right for the government to take the initiative and offer up scrappage benefits to those who are prepared to ditch their diesels and switch to electric cars,\" he said.\n\nThe latest figures from industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed sales of new diesel cars fell 17.1% last year as higher taxes and pollution fears hit demand.\n\nAston University expects a further 10% drop in sales this year and says diesel will account for less than a third of the market by 2020.\n\nDiesels have an image problem. The production of high levels of NOx emissions has made them the target of clean air campaigners.\n\nThe industry argues that the latest generation of diesels is much cleaner than its predecessors. Diesel engines also produce less carbon dioxide - one of the main gases associated with climate change - than petrol equivalents.\n\nBut that message isn't getting through. People within the industry blame anti-diesel rhetoric from the government, which they say has left people confused and worried. To put it bluntly, too many people think if they buy diesels, they'll face tax rises, bans from city centres, or both.\n\nDiesels still account for four in every 10 new cars sold. But demand is falling rapidly. If they are to have a future, then the public and political perception of them will have to change, and change quickly.\n\nThe SMMT said confusion about the future of diesel had fuelled a backlash against the cars.\n\nDiesel vehicles produce most of the nitrogen oxide gas coming from roadside sources, leading to their being targeted by clean-air campaigners.\n\nBut the cars are also generally more fuel-efficient than petrol cars and therefore produce less carbon dioxide.\n\nThat helps car companies to meet targets for reducing CO2, introduced to combat climate change.\n\nThe VW scandal - which showed how many diesel cars, which had passed official tests, were routinely producing much higher levels of toxic emissions when driven on the roads - exacerbated a backlash against the fuel.\n\nDiesel car sales fell by almost a third in December after November's Budget which introduced a levy on new diesel cars that failed to meet the latest emissions standards.\n\nExperts said the one-off tax increase - which comes into effect in April - would be applied to most new diesels.Takeaway food app Just Eat is being criticised after introducing a 50p service charge on all its orders.\n\nPreviously it levied a 50p surcharge on debit and credit card payments.\n\nBut from Saturday 13 January, all card surcharges will be banned when a new European directive comes into force.\n\nCritics say the move by Just Eat flies in the face of the new legislation, which was designed to save consumers up to \u00a3473m a year in card charges.\n\n\"It's wrong for companies to rebrand credit card fees as service charges,\" said Hannah Maundrell, the editor in chief of Money.co.uk.\n\n\"The law was changed to stop businesses from profiting from unnecessary credit and debit card fees. So this makes a mockery of the law which is trying to protect us from getting ripped off.\"\n\nIn a statement, Just Eat said it had already been considering altering the way it charges its customers.\n\nHowever, it admitted that \"the change to legislation did play a part in prompting the review\".\n\nA new look Just Eat bill, showing the 50p service charge\n\nThe change, which took effect on 8 January, has provoked criticism from the firm's customers on social media.\n\nOne said the charge was \"awful\", while others said they did not understand why it was being imposed.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

LG unveiled its \"wallpaper TV' at the CES tech show in Las Vegas\n\nSouth Korean tech giants LG and Samsung have launched TVs that aim to better blend in to consumers' living rooms.\n\nLG showed off a set that can be fitted almost flat against a wall while Samsung teased a new kind of TV - designed to look like a painting - that displays art when not in use.\n\nSamsung also unveiled a flagship set boasting greater brightness levels than before.\n\nOthers, including Sony, also revealed new models.\n\nSamsung's flagship 75in (190cm) QLED 4K TV features the latest version of its quantum dot technology - tiny particles that emit different colours of light.

Gina Miller was the lead claimant against the government in the Supreme Court\n\nThe woman who brought the successful legal challenge against the government over Brexit has accused prominent politicians of behaving \"despicably\".\n\nGina Miller told the BBC they had \"exacerbated\" worries during and after the EU vote and failed to defend her and others with \"legitimate concerns\" about the process in the face of abuse.\n\nShe insists she did not bring her case to thwart the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nBut she said some politicians were in \"la la land\" about what lay in store.\n\nThe investment manager was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the Supreme Court upheld her challenge to the government's approach.\n\nBy a margin of eight to three, the justices ruled that Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit.\n\nMinisters say it was right for the court to decide and they will comply with the ruling.\n\nMrs Miller, who voted to remain in the EU, said she felt vindicated but that her goal all along had been to give a voice to the millions of people with a stake in the process and help deliver \"the best Brexit we can get\".\n\n\"This is about right and wrong, it's wrong that a government think they are above the law. It's right that I can bring this case,\" she said.\n\nThe 51-year old, who was born in Guyana but educated in Britain, suggested the EU referendum had created a climate of fear in which anyone asking questions about Brexit was seen as unpatriotic and \"branded as traitors\".\n\n\"There's this sense that if you ask a question about Brexit then you're not representing Britain,\" she said. \"Asking questions about Brexit is the most patriotic thing you can do.\"\n\nShe added: \"People voted because of legitimate concerns. Politicians have behaved despicably because they have exacerbated those anxieties.\"\n\nAsked if Theresa May and her ministers had behaved \"despicably\", Ms Miller said it was \"wrong of them not to stand up earlier when the judges were being vilified\".\n\n\"I think it was wrong of them to not actually speak up sooner about abuse for not just myself but for other people who live in the UK.\"\n\nMrs Miller, who says she has been subjected to constant abuse including death threats, said she felt her \"family and safety have been put in jeopardy\".\n\n\"The idea that as a woman I had no right to speak out and I'm not bright enough to speak out. And as an ethnic woman I have no place in society. That's worrying.\"\n\nShe said she was still concerned that politicians were \"twisting the truth\" when it came to the UK's future outside the EU and Mrs May and her ministers needed to \"be honest\" with the public about what was achievable from the negotiations.\n\n\"Even now, some of the things I hear about what is possible, as we progress Brexit, it's as though they are living in some sort of la la land because it's pure fantasy.\"\n\nShe added: \"There are 27 other member states on the other side of the table who are not just going to give us what we want. They are not going to give us cherry picking\".Three RAF Typhoons and a British warship escort a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships up the English Channel.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Professor Ted Malloch is gloomy about the euro's future\n\nThe man tipped to be Donald Trump's ambassador to the European Union has told the BBC the single currency \"could collapse\" in the next 18 months.\n\nProfessor Ted Malloch said he would \"short the euro\" - taking a market position which bets on the value of the currency falling.\n\nHe also said", "look like a form of courtship, storylines are scattered as if seeds to the wind, and the overuse of sweeping drone shots of fields and gorges left me reaching for a travel sickness pill.\n\nAll of this while indistinguishable tattooed blokes with long hair go at each other hammer-and-tongs in a blood bath overflowing with gore.\n\nAt this early stage it didn't feel so much like an epic fantasy to compete with Game of Thrones, more an ancient version of Rugby Special.\n\nA Roman army of 20,000 troops led by General Aulus Plautius (who looks like Ed Balls but is actually David Morrissey) has invaded our Scepter'd Isle to do what Caesar couldn't; that is, to tame, tax, and take control.\n\nThis time around the competition doesn't appear to be up to much.\n\nThe two main tribes are too busy fighting each other to care about foreign invaders, while the Druids are preoccupied with inhaling vast quantities of weed and just being plain weird.\n\nThere is also an outcast (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who howls at the moon and runs about, but what could one dishevelled loony do against the might of Rome (the top brass of which have been ordered to speak like Russell Crowe in Gladiator)?\n\nNikolaj Lie Kaas as Divis, once a Druid, who has fallen out of favour\n\nBut then as the writer Jim Thompson once said about the art of telling tales, 'there is really only one story, and that is nothing is what it seems.' And so it is with Britannia, a nine-part series that appears to be an incomprehensible mess at first, but turns into a reasonably compelling mythical tale liberally laced with violence, humour and otherworldliness.\n\nIt is in the strange rites and rituals to be found in the edgelands of rural Britain that Jez Butterworth, one of the three-man writing team behind Britannia, specialises. There is nobody better at capturing the sacred and profane nature of our age-old cults and cultures. Anyone who has seen his play The Ferryman currently running in the West End, or before it Jerusalem with Mark Rylance as Jonny 'Rooster' Byron, will know that.\n\nMackenzie Crook, almost unrecognisable, as the chief Druid, Veran, who speaks for the gods\n\nMackenzie Crook was in Jerusalem with Rylance, playing a local lad under Byron's charismatic spell. In Britannia, Crook has been upgraded to the main man - a wizardy sort called Veran who has terrible skin and a wicked stare. He is the leader of the Druids, and as such, has a direct line to the gods, who are unseen but ultimately control everything. A bit like bankers, I suppose.\n\nIt is to the gods everyone must answer, even the cold and calculating Aulus, whose Machiavellian tactics are to divide and rule. It is a job made much easier for him by the leaders of the two tribes who are constantly, and literally, at each other's throats.\n\nZo\u00eb Wanamaker as Antedia, the fierce Queen of the Regni\n\nThe foul-mouthed Queen Antedia (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in a role too trivial for such a talented actor) of the Regni wants vengeance for her son's private parts, which were whipped off the unsuspecting dope by the Cantii's flame-haired maverick, Kerra (Kelly Reilly). She couldn't care less, as long as she can wear green and continue to flirt with her hunky Gaul friend (Stanley Weber).\n\nKerra (Kelly Reilly), the headstrong warrior and daughter of King Pellenor\n\nThe acting, directing, scripting are all fine, sometimes they are very good, but the show has yet to really take off, although the potential is there.\n\nObviously the whole thing is silly.\n\nIt is not a history programme, it's a fantasy drama with all the swords, sorcery and stone circles you could hope for.\n\nIf you like that sort of thing you'll probably like Britannia, if you don't you won't.The British Airways flight to Mauritius was delayed by over two hours\n\nA pilot was taken off a flight from Gatwick Airport after fears were raised he was drunk.\n\nThe British Airways flight to Mauritius on Thursday was delayed and the pilot replaced, BA said.\n\nAn airline source told The Sun: \"Cops rushed on to the plane and headed straight for the cockpit.

The man was found to be dead.\n\nThe leaked document said the patient \"appears to have frozen to death\". The ambulance trust said it was not in a position to confirm the cause of death as that could only be done by a doctor or a coroner.\n\nThe BBC understands the patient involved was a man in his 50s.\n\nSuffolk police has been approached for a comment on its involvement in the case.\n\nAll of the delays listed in the document sent to the BBC happened between 18 December and 3 January.\n\nOn Thursday it emerged the ambulance trust's medical director Mark Patten was leaving.\n\nThe trust said the decision had been made some time ago.\n\nMr Patten, who had served as medical director at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital, joined the board of the ambulance trust in July 2016.\n\nA trust spokeswoman said: \"The trust had plans in place however experienced extreme levels of demand over the new year period in particular.\n\n\"The trust was unable to respond to a very small number of the 50,000 calls we handled over a 15 day period as quickly as we would like.\n\n\"The trust is undertaking a rigorous analysis of that small proportion of calls.

There were no survivors.\n\nInvestigators will release a preliminary report in about 30 days.\n\n\"The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood", "VR] is going to need to prove that it has taken account of impact on the body of using the headset during strenuous exercise.\"\n\nJob Stauffer, a games developer who now works with the VR Health Institute - who is helping Black Box VR with promotional activities at CES - says he has personally benefited from virtual reality.\n\nHe told the BBC he had lost more than 82lb (37kg) playing such games in addition to improving his diet.\n\n\"Late in 2016, I was probably the unhealthiest I'd ever been in my life, well over 300 pounds,\" he said.\n\n\"And I started playing games on HTC Vive and Oculus and I started to notice that wow, like I'm sweating I'm getting the best workout I've ever had.\"\n\nThe VR controllers are designed to be \"hands-free\" to let users grip gym equipment\n\nMr Stauffer said he started by playing the indie game Sound Boxing, which he described as \"Guitar Hero for the arms\".\n\nHe said he then moved onto Space Pirate Trainer, which he compared with using an elliptical machine - or cross-trainer - in terms of calories burned.\n\nThe VR Health Institute is now developing a Pan European Game Information (Pegi)-style rating system for games to grade them according to their activity level, he added.\n\n\"A lot of people in the games business work an incredible amount of hours and often don't get the time that they need to take care of themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"At the same time playing games is a sedentary experience but VR changes all of that - that room-scale experiences are engaging your body in full.\"\n\nVirtual reality and fitness is a small but growing market.\n\nAt last year's CES a firm called Icaros showed off a cradle that simulated flight while giving users a work out as they planked their way across a mountain range.\n\nAt this year's event a Czech start-up, Sense Arena, is promoting the use of VR to train athletes to play ice hockey, basketball and football. It suggests the tech could ultimately lead to fewer injuries during matches.\n\nMeanwhile at the VR Fit gym in Columbus, Ohio, members can already work out with a virtual reality personal trainer for $60 (\u00a344) per session.\n\nIn my two-minute demonstration, I chest-pressed my way to victory in front of a crowd in a huge virtual arena, punching out bowling balls of fire and, inexplicably, large green birds as I pulled the machine, with more resistance piling on at every repetition.\n\nI was rewarded with a virtual sweat band in a prize box and aching biceps for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nThere was no noticeable latency between my action and the action I saw in VR, and the graphics, while a bit strange, were immersive. It certainly beat watching rolling news programmes in the gym with the sound down.\n\nThe demo appears to have been designed with male testers in mind - the reps were heavy, and the only available profile to compete against was a macho avatar called Razer wearing green armour.\n\nBut the firm was at pains to point out to me that ultimately people could compete against each other, and that other computer-based avatars would also be developed.\n\nOf course the concept of getting fit while playing a game is as old as sport itself, and Black Box has been developed by people who are already very motivated by fitness.\n\nAfter my brief experience I couldn't say whether it would hold my attention in the long run. But on the other hand, neither has my gym membership.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Many parents are worried about the amount of time their children spend on their phones\n\nBig investors have called on Apple to develop software that limits how long children can use its smartphones.\n\nThe call came from two investment groups that hold $2bn (\u00a31.48bn) of Apple stock between them.\n\nA letter calling for the digital locks, signed by Jana Partners and a California teachers' pension fund, was sent to the iPhone maker this weekend.\n\nThe call for better controls was welcomed by academics studying youngsters' use of technology.\n\nJana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) called on Apple to consider the impact excessive use of smartphones had on the mental health of young people.\n\nIn their letter, the two pointed to numerous studies which suggest excessive phone use can disrupt lessons, harm students' ability to concentrate on school work and deprive them of sleep.\n\nThe document also mentioned the impact that \"heavy use\" of social media can have on self-esteem and its possible influence on childhood depression.\n\nThe two are worried that if Apple does not address growing concerns about smartphone use, its stock market value and general reputation could be damaged.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, half of US teenagers believe they are addicted to their mobile phones and feel the need to respond immediately to messages.\n\nThe investment groups acknowledged that a variety of factors were at work in determining a young person's outlook and mental health. But, they added, it \"would defy common sense\" to argue that high levels of phone use were not having some impact.\n\nThe makers of such \"powerful products\" also needed to help parents ensure phones are being used optimally. They called on Apple to improve its current parental control systems which, they said, were a \"binary, all or nothing approach\".\n\nThe two groups said they would welcome the chance to talk about the issues they raised with Apple's board of directors.\n\nChildren are encountering smartphones at earlier ages than ever, suggests research\n\nSonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics, said it was good to hear the call from the investors.\n\nShe added there needed to be one voice between device manufacturers, social media companies and internet service providers (ISPs) on the issue of smartphone use.\n\n\"For a long time the concern has been to not do anything that would impact a friction-free experience,\" Prof Livingstone told the BBC.\n\n\"Everyone would like to have a well balanced life, but the way that devices are designed currently causes a lot of conflict with parents.\"\n\nShe called on Apple and other device manufacturers to have all notifications on smartphones switched off by default and for the creation of occasional reminders that urged youngsters to take a break from their phone after long periods of use.\n\nProf Livingstone, who also runs a parenting blog, did question the use of the term \"addiction\" for those who spend a long time using a smartphone, however.\n\n\"Everyone will agree that there is excessive use and even obsession with smartphones, but I don't believe it's addiction,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement Apple said that it had \"always looked out for kids.\"\n\nApple added: \"We work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system.\n\nWith today's iOS devices, parents have the ability to control and restrict content including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features.

She's a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to fear.\"\n\nHer comments were interpreted at the time as an endorsement of Brexit and conservative policy.\n\nBut writing on her website, Bush said her comments were quoted \"out of context\" and that she found the experience \"deeply frustrating\".\n\nShe continued: \"At the time I discussed the idea of responding to it with close friends and we all agreed it was best to let it go.\"\n\nHowever, the quote continued to resurface - most recently in coverage of her remastered back catalogue, and a book of her lyrics, which was published last month, prompting her to issue a clarification.\n\n\"My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power,\" she said.\n\n\"I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power.\n\n\"I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time - because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM [David Cameron], who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.\"\n\nShe added that the article \"could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not\".\n\nThe star rarely gives interviews and talks about politics even less frequently.\n\nHowever, in 1990 she wrote the score for an episode of the TV comedy The Comic Strip Presents... that featured a homage to Labour politician Ken Livingstone, which featured the lines \"Who's the man we all need?

Craig Mackinlay thanked his South Thanet constituents for standing by him\n\nConservative politician Craig Mackinlay has been cleared of knowingly falsifying election expenses.\n\nThe MP for South Thanet had denied making false declarations during his 2015 campaign, when he beat then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage to the seat.\n\nMr Mackinlay, 52, had been accused of failing to declare more than \u00a360,000 spent on staffing, hotels and adverts.\n\nTory party employee Marion Little, 63, was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of two charges.\n\nLittle, who had effectively run the 2015 election campaign, was found guilty of two counts of encouraging or assisting an offence, but cleared of a third.\n\nThe long-time Tory party member, from Ware, Hertfordshire, had \"acted dishonestly by preparing returns she knew were not completed nor accurate,\" Judge Mr Justice Edis said.\n\nHe described Little as being \"a senior and respected employee of the Conservative Party at its Central Headquarters and has been so for many years\", and said her actions were a \"sustained and deliberate course of conduct\".\n\nThe judge said Little had presented falsified documents to Mr Mackinlay and Mr Gray for signing which \"they did so in good faith not knowing what she had done\".\n\n\"No-one can know whether her misconduct had any effect on the outcome of that election but she plainly intended that it would.\n\n\"She was the author and origin of this falsehood.\"\n\nHanding her a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, the judge said Little had been \"carried away by her conviction\" that defeating Mr Farage was an \"overwhelmingly important political objective\".\n\nHe said the only reason she was not being given a custodial sentence was because she was caring for her husband, who is terminally ill.\n\nJurors at Southwark Crown Court had deliberated for more than 53 hours before reaching their verdicts.\n\nMarion Little told the court she would never falsify documents\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Prince Harry and fiancee Meghan Markle were on their first official visit to Wales\n\nMs Markle, wearing a pair of trousers by Cardigan-based The Hiut Denim Company, described the visit as \"so exciting\".\n\n\"I am so happy that we are here today,\" she said, in Cardiff Castle's stunning Arab room. \"It is a beautiful space.\"\n\nDuring the event, the pair heard performances from musicians and poets and met sportsmen and women, including adventurer Richard Parks, former Wales rugby player Scott Quinnell and Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales.\n\nThe couple ate traditional Welsh cakes and Ms Markle said: \"Very good. Wow, it's great,\" before sampling a wedding cake made from Welsh cheese.\n\nPrince Harry is taking his American bride-to-be on a tour of the UK's towns and cities in the months leading up to their wedding so he can introduce her to her new home.\n\nHis full title is Prince Henry of Wales - and Ms Markle could end up with a title linking her to Wales after the couple get married.\n\nIn the unlikely event the Queen does not give the prince a dukedom on the morning of his marriage, Ms Markle would become Princess Henry of Wales after saying her vows.\n\nAs the sun began to dip over Cardiff Castle, snow spat and the cold deepened. The loyalty of Harry'n'Meghan watchers was being tested.\n\nThe not-quite-yet-royal couple were meant to be doing a walkabout just before two in the afternoon. But even being almost-Royalty does not protect one from that most prosaic of frustrations, a signal failure at Didcot.\n\nSo by the time the show rolled into the castle's ground, the gathered children were singing to stay warm and the adults were maybe wondering quite why they had chosen this particular form of torture.\n\nBut the crowd's patience was rewarded; the couple lingered as they strolled, chatting and taking gifts, enquiringly earnestly as to how long people had waited, smiling and laughing.\n\nIt's fun - and easy - to be cynical about the whole thing; the flags being handed out, the dignitaries waiting nervously, the best laid plans being derailed by signal failures.\n\nBut the couple are charismatic crowd-pleasers. And there is serious intent in these visits - there's the grandeur of a place like Cardiff Castle and then the more down to earth stuff at a leisure centre, involving sport and youngsters and social mobility, the stuff Harry cares about and wants to highlight everywhere he goes.\n\nPeople queued early to get a good spot in the castle grounds\n\nFans who gathered to meet the couple said their story was like a \"fairytale\".\n\nJenna Quilter, 18 from Creigiau, near Cardiff, said: \"It's fascinating that she's not the typical person you'd expect to become a future duchess and it's just really interesting to see the public reaction to her.\"\n\nAbbie Smith, who is visiting Cardiff from Louisiana in the US, said: \"In America this is like a fairytale. I think it's really cool that she's from the States and gets to experience the royal lifestyle as well.\"\n\nHaley Johnston, 26, from Charlotte, North Carolina, added: \"I'm also from the States and I married a British soldier so we have a few things in common.\"\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry later went to the Star Hub leisure centre\n\nLater on Thursday, the couple had a private tour of Star Hub, where they saw how StreetGames, an organisation the prince has worked with previously, is helping to make sport accessible to disadvantaged young people.\n\nCrowds waited outside the leisure centre in Tremorfa to see them.\n\nNiusha Tabrizi, nine, wrote a welcome in Welsh for the pair and said she was keen to see Ms Markle.\n\n\"I want to see how she looks,\" she added.\n\nNiusha Tabrizi waited with her parents in Tremorfa\n\nTen year olds Lataya Marden and Annalise Marshall danced for the couple\n\nYoungsters gathered in Tremorfa to meet the couple\n\nLataya Marden and Annalise Marshall, both 10, danced for the couple.\n\nAnnalise said: \"It was fun and an exciting experience.\"\n\nLataya added: \"I thought it was amazing getting to meet Harry and Meghan.

Why not just drive around it?\"\n\nPark volunteer Jim Allday said the sequoia, also known as the Tunnel Tree, shattered as it hit the ground.\n\n\"We lost an old friend today,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nGiant sequoia are closely related to the redwood tree, which is considered the tallest tree species on earth, reaching 250ft (76 metres).\n\nThey can only grow naturally in the groves of California's Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nThe tree fell as parts of California and Nevada were drenched by a seasonal weather system known as the Pineapple Express.\n\nNot to be confused with the Seth Rogen movie of the same name, the Pineapple Express is an \"atmospheric river\" that extends across the Pacific from Hawaii to the US West Coast, meteorologists say.\n\n\"This is a serious flood situation,\" the National Weather Service said in a special flood statement late Sunday night after the Russian River in California and the Truckee River in Nevada burst their banks.\n\nHundreds of people have been forced to flee their homes in Northern California and Nevada as water levels rise, and avalanches and mudslides close roads.Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nManchester United have agreed to sell midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin to Everton for \u00a322m.\n\nFrance international Schneiderlin, 27, was signed for United by Louis van Gaal for \u00a325m from Southampton in July 2015.\n\nHe has played 47 times for the club but has only featured eight times under Jose Mourinho this season, including three Premier League appearances.\n\nEverton, meanwhile, have agreed to loan striker Oumar Niasse, 26, to Hull, with personal terms still to be agreed.\n\nThe Senegal international signed for \u00a313.5m from Lokomotiv Moscow in February 2016 but has played only seven times for the Toffees.\n\nFollowing United's 2-0 win against Hull on Tuesday, Mourinho said: \"Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward informed me that the situation is close. Morgan is more than probably going to Everton.\n\n\"I am sad and happy, sad because I like him and he could be an option for us, happy because this is what he wants, to play every game and be important in the team.\"\n\u2022 None Listen: 'Man Utd want a defender - but not Lindelof'\n\nManager Ronald Koeman demanded the club make January signings in the wake of their FA Cup third-round exit to Leicester.\n\nThey have already signed 19-year-old forward Ademola Lookman from Charlton for \u00a311m.\n\nIf Schneiderlin, who was also a target for West Brom, moves to Goodison Park he will work with Koeman for a second time, having spent two years under the Dutchman at Southampton.\n\nKoeman still retains a strong interest in another United player, his countryman Memphis Depay, who is also an Old Trafford outcast.\n\nEverton may face competition from abroad for the 22-year-old, who joined United from PSV for \u00a325m in May 2015.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin has struggled to adapt and stamp his personality on anything at Old Trafford. But he gets across the ground well, he can tackle and he gets up and down the pitch.\n\nAt his best he's a typical Premier League central midfield player. Everton are buying someone who you know has been able to produce the goods in the Premier League from his time at Southampton.

It is more than just jumping, it is a health driven way of life,\" he added.\n\nParkour UK chief executive Eugene Minogue said the sport is now in a vast majority of primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, with the UK also boasting 50 Parkour Parks.\n\nHe added: \"All this in just over seven", "ble and hard-working.\"\n\nBut there is a possibility the team dynamic will change anyway.\n\nHow might it affect Hamilton?\n\nDaimler chairman Dieter Zetsche recently provided an amusing insight into Mercedes' relationship with Hamilton.\n\nTalking to Autocar magazine about how he heard the news of Rosberg's retirement, Zetsche said: \"I was stepping out of the shower lacking any clothes and my phone was ringing. And I saw it was Toto and I thought: 'Oh, again something with Lewis!'\"\n\nHis remarks confirm the open secret that Hamilton is not an easy driver to manage.\n\nLike all drivers of his stature, Hamilton can be awkward over PR appearances and other such matters that are expected of drivers but they find tiresome. And he has repeatedly bucked against the authority of the team.\n\nIn ignoring orders to speed up while 'backing' Rosberg into rivals in the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton was metaphorically sticking two fingers up to team management.\n\nWolff initially said he would consider what actions to take. Then, Hamilton spoke of feeling \"disrespected\" by that call. Following Rosberg's retirement, Wolff and soon-to-leave technical boss Paddy Lowe said the orders should not have been issued.\n\nThroughout last season, Hamilton repeatedly brought up the reliability disparity that was giving Rosberg an advantage in their title battle.\n\nIn Malaysia - after his engine failed while he was leading, costing him the championship lead and, as it turned out, the title - he went as far as saying \"something or someone doesn't want me to win this year\".\n\nMany interpreted that wrongly as a suggestion there was a conspiracy in the team. But even as a reference to bad luck or divine intervention, it is a statement that causes Mercedes problems.\n\nAfter Hamilton refused to take questions in a news conference at the Japanese Grand Prix last year, Wolff called such incidents \"collateral damage\", and insisted \"his performances in the car justify\" it.\n\nBut sometimes - if very rarely - Hamilton is not phenomenal in the car. And some in F1 question his 'off' weekends and occasional problematic behaviour as directly linked to his decision to pursue a Hollywood lifestyle. This, they argue, restricts his ability to perform at his absolute best all the time.\n\nThey see his jetting back and forth to the US as a lack of focus and blame it for weekends such as those in Baku and Singapore last year, where Hamilton quite patently, and for reasons that are not clear, just did not bring his 'A game'.\n\nAnd they believe it is facilitated by Mercedes' choice of a team-mate Hamilton knows he can handle.\n\nWolff and Hamilton, meanwhile, insist it is the freedom Mercedes give him to be himself that allows him to perform at his peak - and everyone has a bad day once in a while.\n\nAnd it seems more likely that the 'off' weekends are just part of him, and related to specific aspects of car behaviour, a set-up he cannot get right, or which he refuses to adapt to because he feels it is not working for him.\n\nHis occasional unpredictability is one of the reasons Mercedes need a strong team-mate for Hamilton - and not just to score regular points in the constructors' championship, the main reason Bottas was preferred over Wehrlein.\n\nWhile Rosberg was not on Hamilton's level as a driver, he was close enough to give Mercedes a viable alternative as a counter-balance.\n\nThe likelihood is Bottas will slot in and be - at least - a direct Rosberg replacement. While that is the case, Mercedes might not want a driver with a talent comparable to Hamilton - and the attitude that tends to come with it.\n\nBut if he can't challenge Hamilton regularly, Wolff might, for a number of reasons, wonder whether signing another superstar alongside Hamilton is not such a bad idea after all.\n\nVettel and Alonso, both out of contract at the end of the year, will be watching this with interest.\n\nBottas will go into Mercedes aiming to win races and titles, but he will be as aware as anyone of the challenge facing him.\n\nHamilton will likely already feel emboldened, his position strengthened by Rosberg's departure, and a weaker team-mate would only enhance that feeling.Hundreds of people gathered to release balloons to mark what would have been the eighth birthday of a child killed in York.\n\nKatie Rough was found injured in the Woodthorpe area of the city on 9 January and died later in hospital.\n\nA 15-year-old girl has been charged with her murder.On the face of it, on some of the front pages at least, it seems a slam dunk.\n\nBefore Theresa May gives an important speech on Tuesday outlining her plan for the tortuous process of taking us out of the European Union, there has been a big thumbs-up for Brexit (literally- in the picture he had taken with Michael Gove) from the most powerful individual in the world.\n\nOn top of that, Donald Trump, who'll be in charge from Friday, breezily promises a trade deal with the United States that can be sorted out without further ado.\n\nSince the social and diplomatic embarrassments of Nigel Farage's freelance trips to Trump Tower, Number 10 seems to have worked to get the president-elect on board, and his comments in his Times interview to former cabinet minister Michael Gove seem to illustrate success - with the groundwork prepared for a visit between Mr Trump and Mrs May soon after the inauguration.\n\nMr Trump repeated his wholehearted support for the idea of the UK leaving the European Union, and his comments to the Times suggested he would be in the UK's corner. No prime minister would want to make an enemy of an American president, so who wouldn't want an endorsement like this?\n\nBut, as officials in Brussels and leaders around the EU seek to stick together before getting down to business with the talks with the UK, the government may also be wary about being seen to be cosying up too closely to President Trump.\n\nMrs May shares some of his analysis of many voters' disillusionment with what she describes as the \"privileged few\". But the similarities don't run deep, and for voters, Mr Trump appals as much as he inspires.\n\nFor some in Brussels, Mr Trump's support for Brexit may only harden them against the UK. Diplomacy is a sensitive and complicated business, not used to the brashness of this billionaire.\n\nThe European Commission has already piled in to say that it's not possible to make any agreements before the UK has left the EU.\n\nEven Downing Street said today it would \"abide by our obligations\" and committed only to early conversations.\n\nThe president-elect's straightforward promise that a trade deal can be done with Mrs May without delay may come to haunt them both.Jon Kay finds out people's hopes and fears about the Donald Trump presidency, over breakfast at one of Barack Obama's favourite restaurants in Chicago.\n\nThis is the second in a series of features from a journey along Route 45 in the US, to mark the inauguration week of the 45th president.Last updated on .From the section European Football\n\nEx-Manchester United and Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal says he has retired from coaching after a 26-year career.\n\nVan Gaal, 65, has been out of work since being sacked by United hours after winning the FA Cup in May 2016.\n\n\"I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,\" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.\n\nVan Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ.\n\nHe made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football.\n\nHe cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month.\n\n\"So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,\" he added.\n\nThe Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East.\n\nVan Gaal also said winning the FA Cup was the greatest achievement of his career as it came against the backdrop of his impending sacking: \"I was standing on the gangplank for the last six months. My head was in the guillotine, put there by the English media.\n\n\"In those circumstances you have to try and stick to your vision and inspire the players of Manchester United.\"\n\nVan Gaal played as a", ".\n\nThe government has increased training places, but that is unlikely to have an effect for many years, the paper adds.\n\nThe Sun reports that staff at the Baftas are concerned the Duchess of Cambridge could outshine A-list actresses\n\nThe Sun leads with a report that the Baftas are involved in an awkward behind-the-scenes stand-off with their president, Prince William, over whether he will attend the awards with his wife.\n\nIt says the prince had intended to go to the ceremony next month, after missing it for the last two years.\n\nTwo separate Bafta sources have told the paper that senior staff at the organisation fear that the Duchess of Cambridge could steal the spotlight from A-list actresses if she comes too - and have suggested it would be preferable for him to turn up alone.\n\nAn official Bafta statement published by the paper says the organisation would be delighted to welcome both of them any year they are able to attend.\n\nFinally, a British company has developed a smartphone app that helps commuters overcome an awkward social situation: you want to offer your seat on a crowded bus or train to a woman you think is pregnant - but are not sure and do not want to give offence.\n\nThe Times reports that it alerts passengers within 15ft if a pregnant woman would like a seat - effectively a \"smart\" version of a \"baby on board\" badge.\n\nThe app comes in two parts: mothers-to-be download a \"request seat\" app to send the alerts, while anyone else can download the second app to receive the alerts.\n\nAccording to the paper, once a passenger has received a notification - causing their phone to ping or vibrate - both parties must rely on eye contact to spot each other and the seat can then be offered.Bernie Ecclestone has been removed as Formula 1's boss because the sport \"needs a fresh start\", says new chairman Chase Carey.\n\nCarey has been put in charge by Liberty Media, the US group which completed its $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) takeover of the sport.\n\nThe American told BBC Sport he had \"tremendous respect\" for Ecclestone, but F1 \"needs to be run differently than for the last four or five years\".\n\n\"Bernie is a one-man team. It was not right in today's world,\" he said.\n\n\"The decision-making is not as effective as it needs to be. Clearly it has to be improved.\"\n\nEcclestone has been removed as chief executive but offered a new advisory role as chairman emeritus.\n\nCarey said Liberty had major plans to grow F1 around the world. He said:\n\u2022 None F1 is a \"unique, iconic, global event that is a spectacle second to none\"\n\u2022 None The sport has not grown in recent years as much as it needed to and Liberty could exploit new technologies to do that\n\u2022 None Liberty would protect historic races and sees Europe as the \"foundation\" of the sport\n\u2022 None It would expand, particularly with a view to new events in the US\n\u2022 None Liberty wanted to make much more of the promotion of F1 itself, its participants and individual events\n\u2022 None despite speculation Silverstone could be dropped by 2019\n\nCarey was installed in September and said he had decided over the past four months that Ecclestone, 86, was no longer the right person to run F1.\n\n\"We needed a sport that while respecting what made it great has a sense of energy and innovation,\" Carey said.\n\n\"In many ways, in a simplistic sense, the sport said 'no' too much and we have to start saying 'yes' - not gimmick it up but find ways to do new and exciting things to have the sport continue to grow and interest and excite people.\"\n\nHe said Ecclestone had not been happy about the change but had accepted his new role.\n\n\"I would expect this is difficult for Bernie,\" Carey said. \"He has run this sport for his entire adult life and I respect completely that this is a difficult change.\n\n\"We have tried to deal with him with the respect he's due, which is why we offered him the chairman emeritus title.\n\n\"I have been sincere in saying I value his help and advice as we go forward.\n\n\"He calls himself a dictator. He has run it as a one-man dictator for a long time. I think the sport needs a fresh perspective. But he has a lot to continue to offer and he will always be part of the F1 family.\"\n\nLiberty has brought in former Mercedes F1 team boss Ross Brawn and ex-ESPN sales executive Sean Bratches to run the sporting and commercial sides of F1 under him.\n\u2022 None We will have a British Grand Prix - Carey\n\n'One of the benefits is a fresh start'\n\nCarey added the governance of F1 needed an overhaul.\n\n\"I don't know whether the decision-making is not what it should be because there is too much history amongst the players,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the benefits we bring is a fresh start. We don't have an agenda other than to make the sport great for its fans and that gives us an opportunity to look at how do we create more of a partnership - everybody has a shared vision of where do we want to go and we can align that vision and have everybody trying to move in the same direction.\"\n\n'We must make the story everything it can be'\n\nCarey said he felt F1 was not making the most of its appeal to fans around the world.\n\n\"Bernie deserves enormous credit for the sport he built,\" Carey said. \"It just got sold for $8bn so the proof is in the numbers.\n\n\"But the reality is to be competitive in today's world you need to continue to find ways to connect and excite fans and we need to use all the digital platforms available, have a marketing capability to tell the stories of the rivalries of the stars.\n\n\"They are larger-than-life personalities and you have to take advantage of all the rules to make that story everything it can be, have to make events larger than ever, music and entertainment with sport at the centre of it.\n\n\"I have talked about 21 Super Bowls and that is really what we should have. And then work with our partners - teams, sponsors, promoters, regulator - to ensure the race itself is everything it can be.\"\n\nWill the teams buy shares in F1?\n\nLiberty is to give F1 teams the opportunity to buy equity in the sport. They have rejected an initial offer but talks are ongoing.\n\n\"We would like to be more aligned with the teams and those discussions are ongoing,\" Carey said.\n\n\"We initially made a proposal that had too short a timeframe and we have found a way to have discussion that can have an appropriate level of exchange.\n\n\"Out of discussions of equity will be discussions of where do we want the sport to be. There is a great deal of interest in the equity but first and foremost it is about trying to create more of an alignment with the teams about the future of the business.\"\n\nHe added Liberty would look at the prize-money structure, which many inside the sport believe is too skewed in favour of the leading teams.\n\n\"We'd like owning a team to be good business, running a track to be good business and F1 is a good business, and together we are all figuring out how to share in making the whole business stronger,\" Carey said. \"But dealing with revenue is complicated.\"\n\n'We want races to be more successful'\n\nMany European races are struggling to cope with the high race fees Ecclestone demanded, but Carey said he hoped to find a way to make them more successful financially.\n\n\"I don't think we will make them more affordable,\" he said. \"We will make them more successful. We want to be more of a partner. To be in the US we are not going to own tracks but we will be more of a partner in trying to figure it out.\n\n\"We think these events should be bigger and more profitable than they are and we think, properly run, these events should continue to grow and be even more successful.\"\n\n'What drivers do is unique'\n\nCarey said the leading drivers were \"great personalities\" and he wanted to \"provide enough opportunities for fans to connect with those personalities\".\n\nAnd he added safety was \"critical\".\n\n\"Go and watch one of these cars drive down a track,\" he said. \"Anyone who tells me that is not dangerous by definition and awe-inspiring hasn't been to one of these races.\n\n\"What they do is truly unique. We have a responsibility to make it as safe as we can without undermining the sport.\"South Yorkshire Fire Brigade were called in to assist in giving a polar bear a dental check-up.\n", "ed by President Clinton's well-known oratorical talents.\n\nAndy says: \"President Clinton was amazing, he is an incredible public speaker, I owe him a great deal.\"\n\nBut why was President Clinton so impressed with a South African businessman he had only recently met?\n\nAndy had ambitious plans to help transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, to help pull them out of poverty.\n\nInstead of giving them aid, his plan was to invest in, help run and expand indigenous companies, mostly insurance and healthcare funds, so that populations would not be blighted by ill-health.\n\nAnd instead of being a charity or non-profit organisation, Leapfrog planned to be very much profit-making and offer its investors a decent rate of return. The idea was to make globalisation and capitalism work for the world's poorest people.\n\nAfter a very slow start, the business today has more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) of funds on its books. It currently invests in 16 companies across 22 countries in Africa and Asia that have a combined 100,000 employees and serve 91 million people.\n\nThe son of anti-apartheid campaigners and brought up on a farm outside of Johannesburg, Andy doesn't seem qualified to run a global investment firm on first glance at his CV.\n\nHe has no business qualifications and instead studied philosophy at university, before going on to lecture in the subject.\n\nLeapfrog typically invests in insurance and healthcare firms across Africa and Asia\n\nYet he started investing in the stock market aged 10, using money he made from selling the family's crops on the side of the road. By aged 13, he was making money for clients.\n\nAfter attending the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Andy went to Cambridge University. It was while at Cambridge that Andy spent a summer working for a non-government organisation in India, which he said was \"one of his most formative experiences\" and is the genesis of his future idea for Leapfrog.\n\n\"We were trying to get Indian farmers to adopt drip irrigation, which could triple their production and lift them out of poverty,\" says Andy, now 41.\n\n\"But they just wouldn't do it. At the time, I thought they were being so irrational, but they weren't - they weren't prepared to take the risk of doing something new and seeing their crops fail as a result. Why? Because this would have meant that their children starved.\n\n\"So I thought, why don't we give these people a safety net to enable them to take a chance on bettering themselves, such as insurance cover.\"\n\nAfter spending his 20s lecturing and heading up an organisation that supports social entrepreneurs, Andy started work on Leapfrog. Initially, he got nowhere fast, because, he says, the idea was so new.\n\nMost Leapfrog firms, such as insurer Bima, utilise mobile technology\n\nHe says: \"It seemed close to impossible to begin with, but I just believed so fundamentally in the idea, which I call profit with purpose, of investing in companies that serve the other half of humanity - the four billion people that conventionally have not been served.\"\n\nWith no money coming in, Andy had to live off his and his wife's savings until Leapfrog got its first small investment after a year and a half.\n\nThe Clinton connection then followed, thanks to Andy knowing someone who worked for the organisation.\n\nHowever, the president's September 2008 speech failed to immediately open the investment floodgates, because it was quickly overshadowed by global events.\n\nA week later, investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the world was plunged into the global financial crisis.\n\nYet despite this backdrop, Leapfrog was able to secure $135m of investment by late 2009. Today its institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Axa, JP Morgan, AIG, Swiss Re and the European Investment Bank.\n\nCompanies that Leapfrog invests in and helps run include All Life, a South African insurance firm that gives low cost cover to people with HIV, Kenyan pharmacy chain Goodlife, and India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers. Andy says that Leapfrog helps the firms see revenues grow by an average 43% per year.\n\nRobert van Zwieten, president of Emerging Market Private Equity Association, the trade group for firms that invest in the developing world, says that Andy and Leapfrog have been \"trailblazers\" in helping to create a new industry known as \"impact investing\". These are firms that invest both to make money and to achieve a positive social impact.\n\nHe adds: \"The annual World Economic Forum (WEF) event at Davos has for several years been struggling to work out how to make globalisation and capitalism work for the many and not just the few, but Andy and his team at Leapfrog are already doing just that.\"\n\nNow based in Sydney, Australia, after previously being in New York, Andy says: \"You can do more good if you are profitable, and make more profit because you are good [doing virtuous things].\"\n\nFollow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter @WillSmale1\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.T2 stars Kelly Macdonald and Ewan McGregor at the Edinburgh premiere\n\nThe cast of the Trainspotting sequel have gathered in Edinburgh for the film's world premiere.\n\nOriginal cast members Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner all feature in T2 Trainspotting.\n\nThe sequel has been made 21 years after the first film, which followed the lives of a group of heroin addicts.\n\nThe original was based on a novel by Irvine Welsh, and the sequel is based on his book Porno.\n\nEwen Bremner is back as Spud in T2 Trainspotting\n\nThe new film sees the central characters in the present day, now middle-aged.\n\nEwan McGregor and Kelly Macdonald were among the stars at the premiere at Cineworld in Edinburgh's Fountain Park.\n\nMcGregor described how his initial reservations about making a sequel were soon dispelled.\n\nHe said: \"I think we were all a little nervous about making a sequel to Trainspotting and not pulling it off, damaging the reputation or leaving a stale taste in people's mouths about the original film.\n\n\"But we only felt like that until we read John Hodge's script.\n\n\"We all feel like these are people we know - Renton and Spud and Begbie.

WATCH: YouTube faced criticism for its ad crackdown last year\n\nYouTube faced a backlash from many of its creators, dubbed the \"adpocalypse\", last year when it prevented videos about some topics being able to include adverts.\n\nThis was in response to more than 200 major brands pulling campaigns over concern their ads had been attached to clips featuring hate speech and other extremist content.\n\nMr Mulligan suggested the latest change should prove less controversial.\n\n\"In terms of impact on creators, this makes taking that first step to commercial status that bit harder to reach,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But given how much the platform is growing, higher benchmarks will be easier to meet now than they were a few years ago.\"\n\nThe second part of the effort focuses on the Google Preferred programme.\n\nThis lets brands pay extra to attach their adverts to the top 5% of videos most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds.\n\nUntil now, the process was automated.\n\nBut YouTube said it would manually review all relevant content by the end of March.\n\nIn theory, this process would have alerted YouTube to a controversial clip by vlogger Logan Paul at an earlier stage.\n\nAt the end of last year, the 22 year-old American featured what appeared to be a dead man's body hanging from a tree in Japan's Aokigahara forest in one of his videos.\n\nLogan Paul is one of YouTube's most popular vloggers\n\nMr Paul - who has more than 15 million subscribers - was excluded from Google Preferred last week as a consequence.\n\nYouTube had previously announced that it planned to have more than 10,000 workers reviewing cli", "said.\n\nMr Sutthithepa's six-year-old son and 79-year-old father-in-law, Richard Loring Taylor, were found deceased on Tuesday.\n\nHis two-year-old daughter, Lydia, is still missing.\n\nThe body of 25-year-old Morgan Corey was found on Saturday morning.\n\nAn 89-year-old man who had celebrated his birthday the day before is also amongst the dead.\n\nAll of those killed died of \"multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides\", according to the Santa Barbara County Coroner's Office.\n\nIt has released a list of the victims who have been identified and recovered so far.\n\nThe youngest of the victims who have been located was three-year-old Kailly Benitez, who was one of four children killed as a result of the mudslides.\n\nFour people are still missing, local officials said.\n\nThe first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been scorched by widespread wildfires in December.\n\nAfter a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption.\n\nTogether with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods.\n\nFive hundred extra emergency rescuers arrived over the weekend, joining more than 2,100 personnel from local and national agencies, including the US Coast Guard, the US Navy and the American Red Cross.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

I've done what I've done up to now to protect the memory of the boys and to try to protect their families,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But he did the right thing stepping down - eventually. I won't be speaking publicly about Kingsmills again unless there is some development at the inquest.\n\n\"As far as I'm concern the Barry McElduff incident is over now. But I don't accept his apology. I'll never forgive him.\"\n\nMr McElduff said the \"deep and unnecessary hurt this video caused the families of the victims of Kingsmills is my greatest regret\" and reiterated his apology to them.\n\nTen workmen were killed in the 1976 atrocity\n\n\"Kingsmills was wrong, unjustifiable and sectarian. It should never have happened,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the view that the video was intended to refer to the massacre would \"impede any reconciliation process\".\n\nBarry McElduff has consistently protested that he never intended to cause offence with his Kingsmills loaf video, and that its publication on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills atrocity was just a terrible coincidence.\n\nWith that in mind, his family and friends rallied to his defence and he must have initially hoped that his three month suspension would buy enough time for emotions to cool.\n\nHowever, the criticism never abated, with Sinn F\u00e9in's opponents accusing the party of not matching their initial tough words with appropriate action.\n\n\"I am an Irish republican and believe wholeheartedly in the reunification of our country and an agreed Ireland in which we heal the wounds of the past together.\n\n\"Reconciliation is essential, but that message is not being heard at this time,\" Mr McElduff added.\n\nThe former UUP MLA Danny Kennedy, who is a cousin of Mr Black, said Mr McElduff had \"bowed to the inevitable\".\n\nHe told BBC Talkback it was necessary for Mr McElduff to step down, and said today was \"not a day of celebration\".\n\n\"There is nothing here to celebrate except that at long last a public representative has owned up and taken responsibility for his own actions,\" he said.\n\nBarry McElduff says Kingsmills was 'wrong, unjustifiable and sectarian'\n\nThe DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said it was right that Mr McElduff resigned saying he was not fit for public office and should have resigned in the immediate aftermath of posting the video.\n\nShe accused Sinn F\u00e9in of failing to deal with the situation.\n\n\"By merely suspending him and continuing to pay him, they compounded his disgraceful actions and demonstrated a lack of respect and compassion for the victims of Kingmills and indeed victims more widely.\n\n\"Now is the time for Sinn F\u00e9in to learn the lessons from these dark events and to deal with the fact that it, and many of its individual members, continue to publicly glorify the murderous deeds of the past.\n\nTen Protestant workmen were murdered in the 1976 Kingsmills massacre\n\nUlster Unionist leader Robin Swann welcomed Mr McElduff's resignation but said that \"it should have happened last week\".\n\nHe called for \"a non-partisan candidate who will be a voice for victims to contest this seat against Sinn F\u00e9in\".\n\n\"If a candidate emerges that allows cross-community support to coalesce around, it would send a strong

Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) law was passed at the end of June 2017 and came into force in early October.\n\nThe social networks were given until the end of 2017 to prepare themselves for the arrival of NetzDG.\n\nThe call to police social media sites more effectively arose after several high-profile cases in which fake news and racist material was being spread via the German arms of prominent social media firms.\n\nGermany's justice ministry said it would make forms available on its site, which concerned citizens could use to report content that violates NetzDG or has not been taken down in time.\n\nAs well as forcing social media firms to act quickly, NetzDG requires them to put in place a comprehensive complaints structure so that posts can quickly be reported to staff.\n\nTwitter recently updated the guidelines it follows when tackling hate speech\n\nMost material will have to be removed within 24 hours but networks will have a week to act on \"complex cases\".\n\nFacebook has reportedly recruited several hundred staff in Germany to deal with reports about content that breaks the NetzDG and to do a better job of monitoring what people post.\n\nThe law has been controversial in Germany with some saying it could lead to inadvertent censorship or curtail free speech.\n\nThe German law is the most extreme example of efforts by governments and regulators to rein in social media firms. Many of them have come under much greater scrutiny this year as information about how they are used to spread propaganda and other sensitive material has come to light.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been sharply critical of social sites, calling them a \"disgrace\" and saying they were \"shamefully far\" from doing a good job of policing hate speech and other offensive content.\n\nThe European Commission also published guidelines calling on social media sites to act faster to spot and remove hateful content.Thousands of people attended pro-government rallies in Iran, just after two days of anti-government protests.\n\nState TV showed crowds of black-clad supporters in the capital, Tehran.Crystal Bar in Sheffield has been temporarily closed after the stabbings at a New Year's Eve party\n\nFive men were stabbed at a Great Gatsby-themed New Year's Eve party at a bar in Sheffield.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police were called to Crystal Bar on Carver Street at 02:20 GMT following reports people had been \"stabbed or slashed\".\n\nTwo men in their 20s are in a critical condition in hospital while three others, also in their 20s, suffered \"superficial injuries\", the force said.\n\nA temporary closure notice was posted outside the bar.\n\nThe police closure notice said the bar's owners were due to appear in court on Tuesday\n\nIt states the bar's closure is necessary \"to prevent nuisance or disorder\".

women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its \"Person of the Year\" for 2017.\n\nLast year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment.\n\nThe term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity.\n\nBetween October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times.A 17-year old boy was murdered in Norwood Road, Tulse Hill\n\nFour young men were killed in stabbing incidents in London amid New Year celebrations, the Met Police has said.\n\nThree were stabbed on New Year's Eve and a fourth in the early hours of New Year's Day in unrelated incidents.\n\nAnother young man stabbed on New Year's Day is in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nFive men have been arrested over the death of an 18-year-old in Larmans Road, Enfield.

Yet the reasons are pretty plain.\n\nCompetition between supermarkets is intense. The German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which arrived on these shores in the 1990s, are now big enough to make a real impact. They're steadily eroding the market share of established players, including Tesco, and forcing them to lower their own prices.\n\nAnd if competition regulators allow Sainsbury's to take control of Asda, then Tesco will lose its market dominance - and be faced with a rival just as powerful as itself, with as much bargaining power among suppliers. That could place further pressure on pricing - and profit margins.\n\nIn-store butchers and delicatessens may look pretty and please more discerning customers, but they need to be staffed; and staff cost money. Tesco insists the number of people using them is falling as shopping habits change. Seen in that light, getting rid of a few looks like an easy way to save a bit of cash.\n\nBut Tesco needs to be careful. Removing the things that make it different from the discounters may help it to cut costs - but it risks alienating existing consumers and eroding its brand value.\n\nAfter all, if there is nothing to differentiate the traditional supermarkets from the discounters, won't customers simply go to whichever is cheapest - trapping everyone in an endless cycle of cost cutting and ever-decreasing margins?\n\nPauline Foulkes, national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), said: \"Staff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate, as the cost cutting continues.\n\n\"This is devastating news for staff, who have played a crucial role in Tesco's turnaround project, contributing to 12 successive quarters of growth, solid Christmas trading and over a billion pounds of profit.\"\n\nAs well as reducing its counters, Tesco said that after completing a detailed review: \"We're talking to colleagues about changes in some of our head office teams, moving to a simpler and leaner structure, which will allow us to focus on supporting our customers.\"\n\nIt also said that it made changes to the way it manages its stock which will mean \"a significantly reduced workload, with fewer hours needed to complete the routines\".\n\nMeanwhile, people who work for third party caterers that provide hot food services at some Tesco stores are also facing an uncertain future.\n\nTesco said it will introduce self-service kitchen areas which will affect people employed by caterers.\n\n\"We are working with them to provide as much support as we can,\" said Tesco.Venezuela's political crisis has deepened.

Originally, entries were restricted to British, Irish and Commonwealth authors.\n\nIn 2014, the award was opened to other writers, and since then two out of five winners have been American.\n\nPeter Carey, who twice won the award, was critical of the rule change, saying the prize could lose its \"cultural flavour\".\n\nAnd last year, Mr Faulks, whose best-sellers include Birdsong, described the award as \"irritating\" and called Man Group \"the enemy\".\n\nHe told a podcast that the hedge fund was \"not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes; they're the kind of people literary prizes ought to be criticising...

In the meantime the two prizes [the Man Booker and the Man Booker International] will run as usual this year\".\n\nThe company's statement, which made no mention of any criticism, said it would spend the sponsorship money on another project, to \"promote and improve diversity and inclusion at the firm and across the financial services and technology industries more broadly\".\n\nHelena Kennedy, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: \"We would like to put on record the Foundation's appreciation of Man Group's sponsorship.\n\n\"However, all good things must come to an end and we look forward to taking the prizes into the next phase with our new supporter.\"\n\nThe relationship between the Man Group and the Booker Prize organisation has been strained for", "place warm as it was single-glazed and the doors had holes in.\"\n\nShe and her children spent one month over Christmas without heating.\n\n\"My little girl had an operation during that time and she had to come home from hospital to a flat with no heating\", she said.\n\n\"The landlord just wasn't willing to fix anything.

The lift stopped at random floors on the way down, picking people up. After we got out at the ground floor, I don't think that lift ever went back up.\n\n\"It was only when we got outside that I saw how bad it was.\"\n\nAfter seven months in temporary accommodation, Emma is finally in social housing.\n\n\"Moving in was a struggle as the flat flooded almost as soon as we got here - trying to get the management to fix that was difficult\", she said.\n\n\"As social housing tenants, I just feel like we're not listened to.

That person was then able to change the password, access the account and see a range of personal details.\n\nThis included date of birth, previous addresses and - most significantly - historical information of a host of previous applications for credit, such as loans and betting.\n\nSuch information would be extremely valuable to a fraudster, who could use it to apply for loans and other financial services in the stranger's name.\n\nAfter being alerted to the case, a ClearScore spokesman said: \"When something like this happens, ClearScore makes the worst-case assumption that it is fraud and locks everything down.\"\n\nThe website carries a reminder at the sign-up stage urging the applicant to ensure the correct email address is used. There is also information on the site about staying safe from fraud.\n\nProf Woodward said that a great deal of attention was paid to choosing secure passwords for web-based services and regularly changing them.\n\nHowever, he said that email addresses were an important gateway to people's digital information and should always be entered with care.\n\n\"An email address is the key to your digital life,\" he said, pointing out that dots and underscores could easily be missed when entering an email address in a hurry.\n\nHe said that online services should use two-factor authentication - such as a code to a mobile phone - and ensure that applicants entered their email correctly twice to cut out mistakes.\n\nBanks are also being urged to find other ways to check a customer's identity.\n\nIt is impossible to tell how often errors lead to details being revealed, but the similarities between email addresses - which may only differ with a dot or a dash - make mistakes a regular occurrence.A US teenager convicted of trying to kill her friend in order to please the fictional online character Slender Man has asked for her sentence to be reduced.\n\nMorgan Geyser is serving 40 years in a psychiatric hospital after the near fatal attack in Wisconsin in May 2014.\n\nAlong with her classmate Anissa Weier, she lured Payton Leutner into woods and stabbed her 19 times.\n\nPayton managed to crawl free on to a path and survived.\n\nAll three girls were 12 at the time.\n\nGeyser stood trial for attempted first-degree intentional homicide in adult court, where crimes that severe are usually heard.\n\nHer lawyers claim that because Geyser believed Slender Man would hurt her family if she didn't kill Payton, she should have instead stood trial for the second-degree version in youth court.\n\nAs a juvenile, the 12-year-old would have been locked up for a maximum of three years if found guilty and then supervised until she was 18 but, as it was, the judge gave her the full sentence prosecutors asked for - arguing she was a risk to herself and others.\n\nThe appeal also argues that when she agreed to be interviewed by detectives at the time, resulting in her confession, Morgan Geyser wouldn't have been able to understand what rights she had given up.\n\nDoctors gave conflicting opinions on the severity of her mental health and the treatment she needed.\n\nSlender Man is thought to have originated from an internet competition in 2009, which asked for a modern myth that could ter", "J\u00fcrgen Locadia following a set piece situation.\n\u2022 None Dale Stephens (Brighton and Hove Albion) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

Escaped rhea on the loose at Worcestershire golf course\n\nAn escaped rhea looks set to make its home at a golf course it has been roaming for more than two months.\n\nThe 6ft, flightless bird arrived at Evesham Golf Club, in Worcestershire, in October and staff have so far been unable to catch it.\n\nGolf club workers said it has become \"a star\" since its arrival and is \"more than welcome to stay\".\n\nThe club said it was a pet which escaped from the village of Harvington.\n\nDue to its speed the bird was nicknamed Linford, after sprinter Linford Christie.\n\nA temporary course set up while work is being carried at the site has also been named after the rhea.\n\nClub secretary Fraser Williamson said it was \"monitoring\" the bird's welfare adding the club had liaised with animal charities after it arrived in October.\n\n\"Because it has been a mild winter it has been foraging for itself and effectively has become a wild animal,\" he said.\n\nMr Williamson said Linford was \"growing bigger\" and spent a lot of time by the River Avon.\n\n\"He is a talking point - people enjoy seeing him around the course,\" he said. \"I personally think he is fantastic.\"\n\nThe rhea, which originates in South America, can reach running speeds of up to 40mph (64km/h).\n\nThere were initially fears the bird would damage the course's well-maintained greens but it did \"not seem interested\" in the grass, Mr Williamson added.\n\n\"He is not bothered by members here. He comes quite close - about 10ft (3m), but if you come closer he will trot off.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea produced a Wembley masterclass as interim manager Ole Gunnaer Solskjaer made it six wins out of six to damage Tottenham's Premier League title ambitions.\n\nMarcus Rashford's low finish from Paul Pogba's superb pass on the stroke of half-time stretched Solskjaer's flawless start - but the Norwegian had De Gea to thank for a magnificent display as Spurs laid siege to United's goal after the break.\n\nThe Spaniard made a succession of crucial interventions, 11 in total, including many with his feet, as Spurs tried in vain to avoid a defeat that makes their task of keeping pace with Liverpool and Manchester City even more arduous.\n\nUnited showed great resilience to back up their early positive approach but it was De Gea who broke Spurs' hearts by denying Harry Kane on several occasions, as well as Dele Alli and Toby Alderweireld.\n\nThe result leaves Spurs nine points behind leaders Liverpool and United level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal as they revive their top-four hopes.\n\nFew would have placed Solskjaer as a serious contender on any list to replace Jose Mourinho when he was sacked as United boss in December.\n\nAnd while he may not be the front-runner yet, he has done everything asked of him and this victory against a team in title contention - and with a manager in Mauricio Pochettino who many regard as favourite to be next in the chair at Old Trafford - was the biggest statement of his credentials yet.\n\nMake no mistake, Solskjaer relied hugely on De Gea's brilliance as he formed a one-man barrier to defy Spurs to secure this win, but he also arrived with a positive mindset and team selection that put United right in the game and led to them getting that half-time lead through Rashford's goal on the counter-attack.\n\nThis was his sternest test after a relatively friendly introductory fixture list and, with the help of De Gea, he was able to complete it successfully.\n\nSolskjaer has given a disaffected squad unity of purpose once more, with Pogba seemingly instantly rejuvenated by Mourinho's departure, and this run of wins has rebuilt fractured confidence and belief.\n\nThe odds on may yet be against Solskjaer claiming the job permanently as other names, such as England manager Gareth Southgate and Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone, are mentioned, but if he is undertaking an audition, wins like this do his chances no harm.\n\nDe Gea gave a brilliant demonstration of goalkeeping - showing that feet can be utilised as successfully as hands when the occasion demands - but there was also real cause for frustration for Spurs.\n\nPochettino's side created chance after chance after half-time only to be thwarted by De Gea, captain Kane his victim on several occasions.\n\nNo-one could question Spurs' heart or application but they may feel they could - and should - have done better with many of their opportunities, often giving De Gea the chance to make the saves when more accurate finishing would have left him with no hope.\n\nThis result is a bitter blow to Spurs as they try to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City and the sight of Kane limping heavily and accompanied by a physio after the final whistle is an added worry for Pochettino.\n\nSpurs have had damaging home defeats to Wolves and now United in recent weeks - they cannot afford many more if they are to maintain a meaningful title pursuit.\n\n'Man Utd expect to win every game' - what they said\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am so pleased and I'm proud. After four and a half years, the second half was the best performance I have seen Tottenham play. It was amazing. In football, sometimes you deserves to win and don't and other times, you do not and you win. That is why we love football.\n\n\"We conceded a counter-attack in the first half but the second was the best performance I have seen. We were not clinical and sometimes you score with less opportunities but it is nothing to complain about. The team played unbelievable football and everyone who watched the game can feel the same as myself.\"\n\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solksjaer: \"You expect to win every single game at Manchester United. You won't, but you must think that. That's the mentality of this group.\n\n\"In the first half we were excellent and in the second they put us under pressure. We could have scored a few as well but we had a good back four and David [de Gea] was unbelievable.\n\n\"We created enough chances to put the game away by the break, but if you don't score you will be under pressure. We defended fantastically.\"\n\u2022 None Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has equalled Sir Matt Busby's all-time record of winning his first five league games in charge of Manchester United.\n\u2022 None Tottenham have lost consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2015.\n\u2022 None Tottenham have lost four home league games this season - double the amount they had lost at home in their previous two Premier League campaigns combined (2).\n\u2022 None United have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League - they had only kept two in their first 20 league matches this season.\n\u2022 None Marcus Rashford has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career.\n\u2022 None Paul Pogba has been directly involved in 53% of United's 15 Premier League goals since Solskjaer took charge (4 goals, 4 assists).\n\u2022 None De Gea made 11 saves - only against Arsenal in December 2017 has he ever made more in a Premier League match (14).

What's the secret behind the unstoppable rise of these side-splitting sidekicks?\n\nThe duo's first presenting job was on CBBC's The Ant & Dec show in 1995\n\nTV producer Conor McAnally witnessed the transformation of Ant and Dec from success-hungry teenagers to grown-up lovable comrades. He saw instant potential in the two when they took on their first proper presenting gig on The Ant & Dec Show in 1995 on CBBC.\n\n\"As a producer, you're looking for that spark in a new presenter,\" says McAnally. \"Someone who can reach through the camera and grab an audience. Presenting skills, technical skills, hitting your marks, all that sort of stuff is less important in the initial stages because all that can be trained.\n\n\"But with Ant and Dec there was a symbiosis. They were each other's genuine best friend. They each thought the other was the funniest guy in the world. They wanted to hang out all the time, even off camera. You can't fake that.\n\n\"These guys could dance, they could sing, they could act, and they could talk to the camera like it was their best friend.\"\n\nThey got their first break in 1989 on children's drama Byker Grove. Unusually, Dec is on the left in this picture\n\nIt's Ant and Dec's uncanny knack for talking directly to their audience that lies behind their genius. To many, it feels like watching friends rather than frontmen.\n\nThick Geordie accents have helped to forge this bond with viewers - in a 2010 survey by call centre managers Sitel, Geordie was found to be the UK's friendliest dialect.\n\n\"They seem so natural and so off the cuff, but most people don't know that is because they work very, very hard,\" McAnally continues. \"Their early training as actors meant they really studied their scripts.\n\n\"Beyond that, they really go down in to the essence of the show. What's it about? What's their role in it? What are they bringing to the audience? They're both great students of entertainment television.\"\n\nBehind the seemingly effortless on screen camaraderie lies an unparalleled understanding of TV expertise, believes McAnally.\n\n\"They're both really canny business guys. They understand their value. They understand the business end of television and rights and royalties and the value of the shows they've done. They're sometimes very tough negotiators.\"\n\nAnt and Dec also fronted Pop Idol from 2001-03, which brought back talent shows to prime time TV\n\nWhile Ant and Dec have mastered being front of the camera, they also perfected the art of being behind it.\n\nOver the years the pals struck numerous lucrative TV rights deals through their production companies Gallowgate, which they sold in 2012, and Mitre, launched in 2013.\n\nAs rights holders for many of their productions, in 2015 they pocketed a reported \u00a31m per episode to license Saturday Night Takeaway to US networks.\n\nThe series bombed across the pond - perhaps because its host Neil Patrick Harris couldn't recreate the Geordie duo's mischievous magic - but it didn't stop them netting a cool \u00a315m by the time the series was axed, contributing to their total net worth of around \u00a362m.\n\nAnt & Dec have won the best TV presenter prize at the National Television Awards for 16 consecutive years\n\nIt's this TV prowess which has prevented Ant and Dec from becoming over saturated, despite having touched almost every audience demographic.\n\nToday, their three biggest shows - I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent - each run for short bursts at a time, with gaps in between long enough to leave audiences wanting more.\n\nPerhaps Ant and Dec's biggest appeal is that they seem at home on screen. We've watched them grow up and adapt to the challenges of 21st Century television.\n\n\"As people they became more and more confident and comfortable with being Ant and Dec,\" says McAnally. \"When I started working with them on The Ant & Dec Show, they had been PJ and Duncan.\n\n\"It was a transition period when they went from playing characters on television to playing themselves, but they tackled that head on. Each new show brought new challenges and new opportunities to expand what they could do on screen.\"\n\nNot every challenge resulted in new opportunities of course, but the pair have taken each bump on the road to stardom with grace and humility.\n\nMost notably, their 2008 attempt to bring gameshow Wanna Bet? to US audiences was branded \"unintelligible\" by critics. It was cancelled after six episodes due to issues with viewers being unable to understand the duo's Geordie accents as well as the dull format.\n\nThe pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV in November\n\nAfter The Ant & Dec Show, McAnally went on to produce five more shows with the pair - Ant & Dec Unzipped, Slap Bang, Friends Like These, CD:UK and SMTV. But it wasn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"There were moments where I wondered whether they would stick together. It happens a lot with duos, because working together over extended periods of time inevitably leads to conflict.\n\n\"They both had slightly different ambitions, but they both understood that their friendship was bigger than anything, and that working on their own wasn't as fun. It was a case of one plus one makes four, not two.\"\n\nIn November, the Geordie duo signed a new deal with ITV rumoured to be worth \u00a340m which will see them stay exclusively with the channel for another three years. So there's no chance of them slipping off our TV screens any time soon.\n\nMcAnally concludes: \"There might be better presenters out there in a technical sense, but they absolutely deserve every single award they get, because no one else has ever gotten in to the hearts of the UK population like Ant and Dec.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Produced by Yogita Limaye and Shalu YadavIn 1986 Jill Saward, who has died aged 51, was raped after a gang of burglars broke into the Ealing vicarage where she lived.\n\nHer father, Michael - the vicar of St Mary's, Ealing - and her boyfriend were beaten with cricket bats by the men, who demanded money and jewellery.\n\nIt was a sexual attack that shocked the nation, became headline news and was subsequently labelled the \"Ealing vicarage rape\".\n\nThe media coverage of the case and the sentencing of the men who attacked Ms Saward - who later became Jill Drake - led to a public outcry about how rape victims were treated.\n\nRingleader Robert Horscroft, then 34, who did not take part in the rape, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in the burglary.\n\nMartin McCall, then 22, was given five years for rape and a further five for burglary, while Christopher Byrne, who was also 22, was given three years for his part in the sexual assault and five for the burglary.\n\nDuring sentencing, Old Bailey Judge Sir John Leonard said the trauma suffered by Ms Saward was \"not so very great\".\n\nMs Saward's case affected the way rape victims were treated and is still being felt 30 years later.\n\nThe public backlash against the media coverage and subsequent sentencing helped bring about changes to the way sexual assault cases were viewed.\n\nIn particular, there was uproar at how one of the defendants had been given a longer sentence for the burglary than the attack.\n\nSeveral MPs, including Neil Kinnock, criticised the prison terms handed down - saying they were too lenient.\n\nThe then-Labour leader said during a Commons debate in 1987: \"While it is necessary for judges to remain detached in the name of the law, sometimes they show an insensitivity to the suffering of victims which is difficult to comprehend.\"\n\nAnd Margaret Thatcher, who was prime minister at the time, expressed her \"deep concern\" over the crime of rape following concerns about the case.\n\nMs Saward's case also sparked fierce criticisms about press coverage of rape cases after Ms Saward's ordeal became front page news.\n\nWhile newspapers did not name Ms Saward as the victim, several of them published details which led her to be easily identifiable.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jill Saward, who was gang raped in 1986, says her attackers got the same sentence as for aggravated burglary\n\nThe Sun newspaper printed the location of the attack and a photograph of Ms Saward with her eyes blacked out in the days following the rape.\n\nWhen investigated, the publication relied on the defence that media identification of a victim was only banned after a defendant was charged, which was the case at the time.\n\nSpeaking in 1987 Ms Saward, who was an identical twin, demanded a change in the law to prevent this from happening.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, she said: \"Unless this is done, others may find themselves identifiable by a process of deduction from third parties known to be involved as victims of a crime as I was.\n\n\"This was very distressing both to myself and my family, and the manner in which some newspapers conveyed this information was highly insensitive and offensive.\"\n\nThe law was changed a year later to allow for the right to appeal against lenient sentences and to close a loophole which allowed media identification of a rape victim before a defendant was charged.\n\nThe Press Council also published guidelines on how rape cases were reported to prevent victims' anonymity being breached through jigsaw identification.\n\nThe notorious case put the laws on rape under the spotlight and led to calls by women's groups and politicians to call for changes to the way the crimes were viewed.\n\nThese included making rape within marriage a criminal offence, making oral and anal intercourse classified as rape and tougher sentencing for rapists - all of which have been achieved.\n\nIn 1990, Ms Saward broke new ground when she became the first rape victim in the UK to waive her right to anonymity.\n\nShe co-wrote a book, Rape: My Story, which explored her ordeal and she went on to become a fierce campaigner for the rights of sexual assault victims.\n\nHer decision to speak publicly was driven by a desire to change attitudes towards victims and strengthen the support they receive.\n\nMs Saward launched a help group for those who had experienced sex crimes and regularly appeared in the media to highlight issues faced by victims.\n\nHer commitment to the cause also saw her become a sexual assault case worker and she subsequently provided training to police forces across the country.\n\nOver the years, further changes have been made to the way sexual assault cases are handled - taking into account the way victims were treated.\n\nThese include a ban on allowing an alleged rapist to cross-examine victims while representing themselves in court and restrictions on what evidence can be heard about a victim's sexual behaviour.\n\nNew guidelines were published on the sentencing of sex offenders in England and Wales in 2013 which gave a greater emphasis on the impact on the victim - something Ms Saward had long campaigned for.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, she said: \"So long we've felt left out of the system or surplus to requirement, so to actually see victims' needs and what's happened to victims being put at the forefront of this is really, really good.\"\n\nMs Saward never gave up on her fight for victims' rights, and in 2015 she spoke out against calls to give those accused of sex crimes anonymity.\n\nIn 1998, she came face-", "said, promising \"the most fantastic show I've ever done\".\n\nAfter his tour, he added that he might consider another residency - \"like Kate Bush,\" who played 22 dates at London's Hammersmith Apollo in 2014.\n\nThe star's hits include Tiny Dancer, Candle in the Wind, Benny and the Jets and Your Song\n\nThe star added he had come to the decision to spend more time at home with his husband, David Furnish.\n\n\"David and I sat down with a school schedule and I said, 'I don't want to miss too much of this.'\n\n\"I'm not stopping music. I'll hopefully be making more records. I'll be writing more musicals. But mostly, I'll be taking my kid to soccer academy - which is the most important thing.\n\n\"Life is all about change.\"\n\nSir Elton said he would be \"creative up til the day I die\" and that his farewell tour would be \"a wonderful way to thank people\".\n\nHis two sons - who will be eight and 10 when the tour ends - will join him for parts of the tour, being taught by a tutor.\n\n\"I don't want to miss them and I don't want them to miss me,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He told the court the coach left the room after he kicked out and tried to move away from him.\n\nHe decided to go to the police after seeing media coverage of other former youth players alleging abuse by Mr Bennell in 2016.\n\nHe told the court: \"I feel guilty because I never said anything.\n\n\"I now know the level of abuse that some of the others would have gone through for sustained periods and if I said something, and I know everyone else probably feels the same, but if I had said something maybe that could have stopped.\"\n\nHe said he was approached by police in the 1990s, but denied having been abused by Mr Bennell.\n\n\"I didn't want to open the box in my head, I just wanted to forget about it,\" he said.\n\nDefending counsel Eleanor Laws QC said: \"I suggest to you, you rather got swept up in these allegations and that what you have said Barry Bennell did to you is not the truth.\"\n\nMr Bennell denies 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14.Shops, cafes and businesses will offer free water refill points in every major city and town in England by 2021.\n\nIndustry body Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year.\n\nThe move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment.\n\nWhitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is the first to sign up to the initiative and will provide water in all of its branches from March 2018.\n\nRefill stations and public fountains will be able to be found via an app or window signs pointing people in the direction of the nearest one.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

and cowboy hat - meant he was the most easily recognised.\n\nBut Sawyer, who was born in Chickasaw, Alabama, in 1937, did take lead vocals on one early hit, 1972's Cover of the Rolling Stone.\n\nIn the song's lyrics, he sang: \"The biggest thrill we've never known is the thrill that'll getcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.\"\n\nDr Hook did eventually appear -

admissions to hospitals have increased by 17% in the past decade to just over 2% of the total number.\n\nBut the use of specialist Alcohol Care Teams has seen a significant reduction in A&E attendances, ambulance callouts and readmissions.\n\nThe teams offer specialist help to patients on how to give up drinking and support to stay off it, which includes written advice, as well as counselling.\n\nThat scheme is already running in Bolton, Salford, Nottingham, Liverpool, London and Portsmouth.\n\nPregnant women who smoke will be given help to quit\n\nIt will now be expanded to 50 hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions across the country.\n\nAnd every smoker admitted to hospital - around half a million people a year - will be offered specialised support to quit.\n\nThis includes pregnant women and their partners.\n\nRecent figures show that 10% of women in England are still smoking when their baby is born, which can double the risk of stillbirth and increase the risk of miscarriage.\n\nAreas of particular need, such as Blackpool where one in five pregnant women smokes, will be given priority over the next five years, NHS England says.\n\nSimon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said: \"Drinking to excess can destroy families, with the NHS too often left to pick up the pieces.\n\n\"Alcohol and tobacco addiction remain two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death, and the right support can save lives.\"\n\nHe said the long-term plan delivered a \"sea change in care for a range of major conditions\" like cancer, mental ill health and heart disease.\n\nAnd he said it gave patients \"the support they need to take greater control of their own health and stay fitter longer\".\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many patients only come to the attention of the NHS during their first stay in hospital.\n\n\"Every contact a health professional has with a patient is an opportunity to help the patient give up smoking - having a system in place to treat tobacco dependency with allocated funding will help make it happen.\n\n\"The focus on the management of alcohol-related disease is also very welcome.\n\n\"We mustn't forget prevention though and further measures to reduce harmful drinking are much needed.\"\n\nSmokers' campaign group Forest criticised the NHS initiative as being \"tantamount to bullying\".\n\nIts director, Simon Clark, said: \"It's stressful enough being in hospital without the additional pressure of being hounded to stop smoking.\n\n\"Pressuring smokers to quit, especially if they're in hospital for a non smoking-related reason, is an invasion of privacy.\"\n\u2022 None Hunt- 'I would like to have long-term NHS plans' -

Today I felt I can do this, it is such a great opportunity for me.\"\n\nKonta described facing Williams as the \"best experience of my life\".\n\nIn a match of big hitting and small margins, it was Williams who established an early control she would not relinquish.\n\nThe American's usually dominant first serve faltered as she made just 45%, but she returned brilliantly to break the Konta serve - the best on tour this season going into the match - four times.\n\nKonta had the first chance but went long with a backhand on break point at 1-1, then found her second serve under greater pressure than at any stage of the tournament so far.\n\nWilliams looked razor sharp on return, with two thumping forehand winners setting the American on the way to a 3-1 lead.\n\nMore heavy blows brought a second break, and with it the set, in game eight to end a run of 18 straight sets for Konta stretching back to her warm-up win in Sydney.\n\nKonta showed why she had been seen as a real threat by recovering from 0-40 early in the second set and then breaking to lead 3-1, but a loose game handed the advantage back and Williams raced through five straight games to victory.\n\nNo matter how many times you have watched Serena Williams play, it is perhaps just not possible to appreciate how hard she hits the ball - and how quickly it arrives on your racquet - until you have shared a court with her.\n\nJohanna Konta had her first experience of that today and was not able to maintain the standards she had set earlier in the fortnight when faced with such persistent pressure.\n\nBut a run to the quarter-finals means she could well retain her position in the world's top 10.\n\nAfter a few days' rest, Konta is planning to play Fed Cup for Great Britain in Estonia and then rejoin the tour in Doha and Dubai. She has a packed schedule ahead, although may play one or two fewer tournaments if she keeps winning matches at the same rate.\n\nLucic-Baroni 'in shock' at return to semis\n\nWorld number 79 Lucic-Baroni upset Pliskova to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne - 18 years after she reached the same stage at Wimbledon.\n\nThe 34-year-old hardly played in the early years of the century because of a series of personal issues.\n\n\"I can't believe this, this is crazy,\" said Lucic-Baroni.\n\n\"The only thing I can say is God is good. I can't believe I'm in the semi-finals again. I feel a little bit in shock right now.\n\n\"I know this means a lot to every player but to me this is overwhelming, this has truly made my life and everything bad that has happened OK.\"\n\nLucic-Baroni was a tennis prodigy, winning junior titles at the Australian and US Opens, and winning the Australian Open doubles with Martina Hingis in 1998.\n\nShe went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon the following year, losing to Steffi Graf.\n\nLucic-Baroni and Williams will meet for the first time since Wimbledon 1998 in Thursday's semi-final, which begins at 03:00 GMT.\n\n\"It is really happening for the mid-30s,\" said Williams.\n\n\"Mirjana - it is so good to see her back out and inspiring to see her in the semi-finals. Whatever happens there will be someone in the final in their mid-thirties.\"\n\nSerena's sister Venus takes on fellow American Coco Vandeweghe in the other semi-final.The man (not pictured) was stopped by police after cycling for 30 days\n\nA man hoping to cycle home cross-country for Chinese New Year realised 30 days into his trip that he had been travelling in the wrong direction.\n\nThe young migrant worker from China was aiming for his home in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang province, after setting off from Rizhao - over 1,700km away.\n\nBut he was stopped by traffic police 500km off course, in the central Chinese province of Anhui.\n\nWhen they found out, the police paid for a train ticket to get him home.\n\nThe man had set off from Rizhao, in Shandong province, in December.\n\nA report from the People's Online Daily said the man had been living in internet cafes and was low on funds.\n\nBut he was determined to make it home so he chose to cycle the route.\n\nThe unnamed man could not read maps, meaning he had to rely on others for directions.\n\nPolice stopped him when he was riding on a highway, which cannot be used by cyclists.\n\nAfter discovering his mistake, both police and people working at the toll station he was stopped at contributed to his ticket home.Amid concerns over his attitude to climate change, the new President has signed orders to push forward with two major oil pipelines\n\nAre the recent actions taken by the Trump team on the issues of climate and energy the opening shots in a war on knowledge?\n\nOr are they simply what you'd expect from a new administration of a different political hue?\n\nLet's examine what we know.\n\nJust after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president, a range of information on the White House website related to climate change was moved to an Obama online archive.\n\nThe only references to rising temperatures on the new Trump White House site are a commitment to eliminate \"harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan\". This was President Obama's broad-based strategy to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe brief White House document now contains a further indication of the green priorities of the new administration. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), should focus on its \"essential mission of protecting our air and water\".\n\nThe Twitter account of Badlands National Park has seen a number of tweets relating to climate change deleted\n\nWhile the administration figures out how to achieve that re-focus, staff at the EPA", "a Brexit without winning back control of our borders, laws, taxes and trading relationships would be a \"fake\" Brexit.\n\nThe Financial Times says Theresa May has had a difficult start to the New Year, with the resignation of Sir Ivan and tensions in government over her management style.\n\nThe Prime Minister gets a mixed review from Saturday's newspapers\n\nThe threat by the Conservative Party donor, Sir Andrew Cook, to withdraw financial support if Mrs May pulls Britain out of the EU's single market, is the main story for the Times.\n\nThe paper says sections of the business world are pressing ministers to pursue a \"soft Brexit\", allowing Britain to have access to the single market in return for some form of payment and a compromise over free movement.\n\nThe Mail takes aim at the Economist for what it calls a sneering hatchet-job in this week's issue, in which it accused the Prime Minister of indecision and muddle. The newspaper urges her to ignore the carping and get on with the job.\n\nWith a 17 point lead in the polls, it says, she has the country firmly on her side, and the prize is huge.\n\nThat prize, the Telegraph agrees, is going down in history as one of our great prime ministers if she can pull off a successful Brexit and begin to rebuild the UK's domestic institutions.\n\nThe Guardian pays tribute to Michelle Obama, following her final speech yesterday as America's First Lady before President Obama leaves office. It describes her as the most inspirational First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nLike Mrs Roosevelt, she has proved to be not an old-fashioned helpmeet nor an ornament, but a powerful advocate of equality in her own right, the paper says.\n\nIt recalls that Mrs Obama was born into a black working-class family that encouraged and expected her to excel, amid the deep racism of 1960s Chicago. Those experiences, it says, have given her both a deep sense of what is wrong with America and of what people are capable of achieving.\n\nThe Express leads with research suggesting that an hour's snooze after lunch is good for your health. American scientists believe it can prevent your brain from ageing and help you perform better in memory tests.\n\nSiestas are good for you, but they cannot be any longer than 60 minutes, according to researchers\n\nThey examined 3,000 adults over the age of 65 and found that those who slept in the afternoon were better able to solve simple maths problems and memorise words - and those who didn't, performed badly.\n\nBut the paper warns that the nap has to be for 60 minutes. A longer or shorter siesta won't have the same effect.\n\nFinally, forget about camping, or glamping. The Times reports that more and more people are choosing to spend their weekend breaks \"champing\" - camping in churches.\n\nApparently, the trend grew four-fold last year and the Churches Conservation Trust, which runs the scheme, is raising the number of churches taking part from seven to 12.\n\nThe experience is basic, the paper warns, with no central heating, no showers, and no curtains. But prices start from \u00a319 a night.\n\nA spokeswoman tells the paper: \"We didn't want people to see our churches as museum pieces. Instead, we wanted them to be living, vibrant places.\"At least 43 people have been killed in a car bomb blast in the rebel-held Syrian town of Azaz, near the Turkish border.\n\nThe explosion occurred outside a courthouse in the town, just 7km (four miles) from the Turkish frontier.Travellers have been stranded at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida after a gunman opened fire earlier on Friday, killing five people.\n\nThe suspect has been identified by police as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, an Iraq war veteran.\n\nSome airport passengers described what they saw and heard.The family of a man whose torture was broadcast on Facebook have thanked the community and local police for their response.\n\nThey have asked for privacy from the public as they \"cope and heal\".\n\nFour people have been charged with hate crimes in relation to the Chicago assault, that police say lasted two days.LeEco sounds French to some - but the firm is a home-grown Chinese venture\n\nChina's disregard for intellectual property, and a turn-a-blind-eye culture when it comes to blatant counterfeiting, is notorious - the butt of many jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been fair. In China they don't just counterfeit devices, they counterfeit entire shops - a knock-off Apple store was closed down in 2015.\n\nInstances like this play into the West\u2019s view of China as the world\u2019s shameless imitator. A place where great ideas from the US and Europe go off to be assembled as cheaply as possible.\n\nIt's time to update that view.\n\nAt CES, the US's biggest trade show, Chinese companies could be found competing not only on price, but on fantastic ideas and design.\n\nAs China's consumers have matured - and by that I mean, got a lot richer - so too has its technology industry.\n\nLike many a British popstar, China is intent on breaking America. But the question is whether Chinese firms can earn greater trust from Western consumers.\n\nOccupying a sizable booth in CES's North Hall is LeEco. It's pronounced \"Luh\" and \"eco\" as in ecosystem.\n\nOn display here is a concept Tesla-like sportscar, some Smart bikes with Google's Android software built in, and a 12in (30cm) TV. The point: they do a lot.\n\nChinese billionaire Jia Yueting, chief executive of LeEco, has been at CES this year\n\nLeEco was for a while known as the Netflix of China, a company that streamed content and eventually started making its own original material. Now it's branching out quickly into hardware - and started selling devices in the US at the tail end of last year.\n\n\"People assume LeEco\u2026 they think it sounds French,\u201d says Kenny Mathers, from LeEco's marketing team.\n\n\"Our name means joyful ecosystem. When consumers get to pick up our products they\u2019re delighted with build quality and design.\"\n\nSounding French is a good thing for a Chinese company, Mathers acknowledged, as it removes a trust barrier for people used to words like Apple rather than, say, Xiaomi. That said, I\u2019ve heard at least five different pronunciations of LeEco this week.\n\nLooking around the booth I spotted what looked very much like a GoPro camera, and I put it to Mathers that even here we're still seeing a disregard for Western intellectual property.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say that,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say that there\u2019s a lot of innovation in our products. We've had a huge number of innovations in our phone line - we were the first company to remove the audio jack.\"\n\nHe is of course referencing Apple\u2019s controversial decision to remove the headphone socket from its latest iPhone - though I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s been a particularly popular move by either company.\n\nLeEco won't be drawn on reports of its money woes - back in China it\u2019s reported that Haosheng Electronics, one of LeEco\u2019s suppliers, is taking legal action over unpaid bills. LeEco has denied reports it has failed to meet its financial obligations.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from research firm Gartner, sitting third in the global smartphone sales race - behind Samsung and Apple - is Huawei.\n\nAlready the biggest supplier of telecoms infrastructure in Europe, Huawei was one of the early entrants into Western markets - though in the US it was coy. The company made Google's Nexus 6P, released in 2015, but until now hadn't undertaken any serious attempts at pushing its own brand.\n\nHuawei unveiled its Mate 9 phablet at the Las Vegas tech show\n\nThe new Mate 9, a so-called phablet, is the company's first high-end device to be launched in the US. One stand-out feature is a built-in voice assistant.\n\nCuriously, while the company makes its own AI assistant, it has opted to integrate Amazon\u2019s Alexa into this device instead. I wondered if it was because US users might not trust a Chinese firm with such broad data gathering. But Richard Yu, H", "irstow completing an excellent stumping.\n\n'The desire is still there' - what they said\n\nEngland wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, speaking to BBC Test Match Special: \"I'm going to have to put some aftersun on! It was a tough day. The boys have toiled really hard.\n\n\"I think the way Mason and Moeen bowled - the control Moeen had, especially early on, was fantastic. It was good to see him bowl with that. There's been a load of questions asked but there have never been any doubts in our set-up about Moeen.\n\n\"It's quite laughable sometimes when people question players in our side. It was only a few weeks ago that people were saying Cookie should be dropped, and look how that played out. There's no question that the effort and desire is there. It's been a tough trip but the desire is still there.\"\n\nFormer England batsman Ed Smith on TMS: \"I've been quite critical of Khawaja this series. There's a vagueness and disengagement about him when he's out of form.\n\n\"Sometimes he seems to drift through the game, but not so here. He used all the different options against the spin.

This was the last time she was seen alive and it is believed she was murdered within hours of her disappearance.\n\nThe cause of her death was strangulation and it is thought Anne's body was stored before being moved to dense woodland in Rose Grove Woods, known locally as Young's Wood in Horn Hill.\n\nScotland Yard was involved in the search for Anne's killer\n\nDue to the condition of the body when it was found, it was considered she may have been held in cold storage for some time. It led to the press dubbing her killing the Deep Freeze murder.\n\nHer family remains desperate to understand what happened to her, police said.\n\nThe case has been reviewed several times, including as recently as February last year.\n\nMick Flavin, of Hertfordshire Police cold case team, has appealed for witnesses to get in touch\n\nMick Flavin, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire case review team, has admitted there is a good chance Anne's killer might be dead.\n\n\"Six decades later, we are appealing for anyone who may have information but may not have felt that they could come to police earlier to please get in touch,\" he said.\n\u2022 None The mystery of the 'Deep Freeze' murder\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Syria and Russia deny targeting hospitals or other civilian areas\n\nAt least 10 hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria have suffered direct air or artillery attacks over the past 10 days, aid workers say.\n\nAn adviser to a coalition of medical charities told the BBC that the attacks had been the most intense for a year.\n\nA senior UN official also told the BBC that health facilities in Syria had been hit \"yet again\".\n\nMeanwhile, 17 civilians died in air raids in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, on Saturday, a monitor said.\n\nThe most deadly raid was in Hammuriyeh where 12 people, including two children, died, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nLast week, at least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes on two towns in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. About 400,000 people there have been under siege by Russian-backed Syrian government forces since 2013.\n\nThe Syrian government and Russia military have consistently denied targeting civilian areas.\n\nAid agencies said medical centres hit by recent air strikes included a maternity hospital in Maarrat al-Numan, in Idlib province, which was reportedly hit three times in four days.\n\nFive people died in the worst attack, on Wednesday, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), and the hospital was temporarily put out of service.\n\nHamish de Bretton-Gordon, who advises the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), said other attacks in recent days had targeted hospitals predominantly in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of the capital.\n\n\"This has been at a level, again, we haven't seen,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim\n\nMr De Bretton-Gordon said many children in Eastern Ghouta needed medical evacuation.\n\n\"There are over 125 children needing live-saving surgery, including three very young children [whose injuries are] too graphic almost to describe,\" he said.\n\n\"A six-month old who has lost an eye who will die if he doesn't receive surgery and an eight-year old girl who weighs only 8kg [17lb] who is dying of malnutrition.\"\n\nThe UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Syria, Jan Egeland, also told the BBC that several of the remaining health facilities in the Eastern Ghouta had been hit \"yet again\".\n\n\"This war is continuing as bad in 2018 as it ended in 2017,\" he said.\n\nOther attacks on medical facilities documented by UOSSM include:\n\n\"This fresh wave of attacks on medical facilities is sickening and unacceptable,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"These attacks force facilities to shut down, terrorise staff and result in undue hardship for patients already suffering.\"\n\nHe added: \"Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been hundreds of well-documented attacks on medical facilities in Syria. It's shameful that there has never been a formal prosecution for these war crimes and it severely undermines the UN's credibility.\"\n\nAt least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes in Eastern Ghouta last week\n\nThe Syrian government recently allowed Red Cross teams to evacuate 29 critically-ill patients from the Eastern Ghouta as part of a deal that saw rebels release the same number of prisoners.\n\nHowever, hundreds more patients are in urgent need of evacuation from the enclave.\n\nThe Eastern Ghouta is designated a \"de-escalation zone\" by Russia and Iran, the government's other main ally, along with Turkey, which backs the rebels.\n\nBut hostilities intensified in mid-November when the Syrian military stepped up air and artillery attacks on the enclave in response to a rebel offensive.The dossier alleged that Donald Trump had links with Russia\n\nTwo senior US senators have called for an investigation into an ex-MI6 officer over a dossier he wrote about President Trump's alleged Russian links.\n\nDuring a senate judiciary committee, the Republicans found that Christopher Steele had passed details from the dossier to \"multiple US news outlets\".\n\nThis could mean Mr Steele made \"false statements\" when being interviewed by the FBI.\n\nThey have now given the communications to the US", "to this, he says: \"There are 16 or 17 other states that grow very fast, you see a lot of dynamism.\" These he describes as \"Nafta states\" with exporting businesses.\n\nHowever, he dismisses Mr Trump's criticism of Mexico. \"He says [Nafta's] been great for Mexico, actually his whole argument is that Mexico is doing so well. It's flattering.\"\n\nHe also claims that the US is benefiting from its close manufacturing links with Mexico.\n\nHowever, when I ask who would come off worst if Nafta were repealed, the US or Mexico, he answers, \"Mexico because we are smaller, but the US would lose quite a bit as well.\"\n\nDonald Trump wasn't the first US presidential candidate to criticise Nafta. Hillary Clinton and even Barack Obama did so on their campaign trails.\n\nBut abandoning it completely? The US may find it has too much to lose and perhaps Mr Trump has realised that too.\n\nIn Business: Mexico and Mr Trump is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 5 January and at 21:30 GMT on Sunday, 8 January.Archaeologist Stuart Wilson, who spent his life savings on a plot of land in Wales 12 years ago, has been proven right after uncovering a 13th century settlement.\n\nThe ancient town of Trellech was believed by academics to be situated under a modern village nearby, until Wilson and his team of volunteers began making progress.A five-month-old elephant calf has been receiving hydrotherapy after its leg was caught in a trap.Mona Tinsley's face smiled out of countless newspaper articles and police leaflets\n\nIt is 80 years since the murder of 10-year-old Mona Tinsley, a case which was by turns grisly, seedy and bizarre. It enthralled a nation and helped change the age-old principle that a murder could not be proved without a body.\n\n\"Oh it couldn't possibly be him,\" said Lilian Tinsley to the assembled police.\n\nOfficers had a lead in the disappearance of Mona, her slight but sprightly 10-year-old daughter, but needed help.\n\nJust hours after she vanished after leaving her Newark-on-Trent school on 5 January 1937, a witness identified a man seen nearby as a former lodger from the Tinsleys' home.\n\nLocal historian Chris Hobbs said: \"The reaction of Lilian and her husband Wilfred, when questioned, was odd. They seemed evasive.\n\nThe house at the centre of the case has changed little on the outside\n\n\"When pressed by officers, Mrs Tinsley admitted they briefly had a lodger, known to the children as 'Uncle Fred'.\n\n\"Eventually she gave a name, Frederick Hudson, and, seemingly with great reluctance, the fact he was a friend of her sister Edith Grimes in Sheffield.\n\n\"Why would the parents be like this with the safety of their daughter at stake?\" Mr Hobbs queried.\n\nA possible, and murky, answer would emerge.\n\nMrs Grimes gave them a slightly different name - Frederick Nodder - but insisted she had not seen him for months. This turned out to be a blatant lie.\n\nOfficers quickly found a neighbour who had seen Nodder in Sheffield just after Christmas, driving a lorry marked 'Retford', a market town in Nottinghamshire.\n\nThis led them to a haulage firm which provided an address in the nearby hamlet of Hayton. It was only a day since Mona had disappeared.\n\nBritish justice was haunted by the wrongful execution of three people in 1660\n\nLegal historian Benjamin Darlow says: \"This principle dates back to the case of William Harrison in 1660, known as the Campden Wonder. Mr Harrison disappeared from near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, in 1660 and two men and a woman were found guilty and hanged for the crime.\n\n\"In 1662, Mr Harrison turned up with a story about being kidnapped. This had a dramatic impact on English criminal law and the 'no body, no murder' principle survived for the next 294 years.\n\n\"The Mona Tinsley case was part of an important narrative in the 20th Century which built up to the abolition of the principle in English Law in 1954.\n\n\"It was perhaps the most high-profile and widely reported case in this timeline.\n\n\"There is no longer a 'no body, no murder' principle in English criminal law.\n\n\"A murder conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence if it is compelling and convincing enough.\n\n\"While the principle is gone, it is still very difficult to prove murder without a body, unless there is alternative strong evidence pointing to the murderer.\"\n\nConfronted outside his rented house, Nodder, 50, denied any involvement but a girl was seen at the house at about noon that day, just a few hours before.\n\nA search found a child's drawings as well as fingerprints on crockery. Nodder was arrested.\n\nWitnesses placed him on a bus from Newark to Retford on Tuesday afternoon. He was accompanied by a girl.\n\nFaced by this evidence, Nodder asked to see Mrs Grimes, insisting this would lead to Mona being found \"alive and well\".\n\nNodder's house (centre, between trees) was a short distance from the Chesterfield canal\n\nMr Hobbs said: \"It came out that Mrs Grimes had in fact seen Nodder on a weekly basis since he left Sheffield. She knew full well where Nodder lived but did not tell police.\n\n\"Newspaper reports describe them as being \"friendly\" but it is striking how both she and Mrs Tinsley tried to deflect attention away from Nodder.\n\n\"It seems likely Mrs Grimes was having an affair with him but it is surprising both she and Mona's own mother were prepared to obstruct the police investigation.\n\n\"Had it delayed the search by vital hours?\"\n\nHundreds of people turned out to search fields and help police drag local rivers\n\nBut when they met, Nodder offered only a statement insisting he had sent Mona to Sheffield to see Mrs Grimes.\n\nNobody believed a word of Nodder's new statement - but the lack of a corpse hampered the investigation.\n\nAfter searches of the house, garden, nearby countryside and the ominously close Chesterfield canal, and just beyond it the River Idle, fat with winter rain, no new trace of the girl was uncovered.\n\nOn 10 January 1937 Nodder was charged, but only with abduction.\n\nDivining, or dowsing, claims the twitching of sticks can locate lost objects or water sources\n\nThe desperate search for Mona used many conventional methods - but also some more bizarre efforts.\n\nDiviners - who search for an item with the aid of sticks or rods and mysterious intuition - featured prominently in the hunt for the girl, often seeming to direct the efforts of police.\n\nMost prominent was James Clarke of Melton Mowbray, who, carrying one of Mona's shoes and guided by whalebone sticks, focused on a gravel pit. On 14 January he told the Nottingham Post, \"Never was I more confident of success. I am so confident that if I was younger I would dig myself.\"\n\nThe pit was cleared. Nothing was found.\n\nSeveral mediums featured in the case.

Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said recommendations had not been properly addressed\n\nA prison is not fit for purpose because of its low standards and failure to do more to prevent eight people taking their own lives over the past six years, a watchdog has said.\n\nHM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said each of the deaths at Swansea prison were within the first week of arrival.\n\nFour of those happened before an inspection in 2014 and the latest visit found lessons had not been learnt.\n\nHer Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) said action was taken.\n\nInspectors also found issues with violence, overcrowding and self-harm.\n\nThe Prison Governors Association said the \"issues highlighted in the Swansea report are fairly systemic across the prison system\".\n\nChief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said the inspection in August 2017 was \"very disappointing\".\n\n\"Between our last inspection in 2014 and when we went back in the middle of last year there have been four further self-inflicted deaths - all in similar circumstances, all in the early days of the individual's imprisonment at Swansea jail,\" Mr Clarke said.\n\n\"Quite simply, not enough has been done to understand the sort of problems they may have been facing and to prevent them inflicting harm and death upon themselves.\"\n\nIn the six months before the latest inspection there were 134 cases of self-harm, which Mr Clarke said was \"clearly unacceptable\".\n\nEight people took their own lives over the past six years at the prison.\n\nHe said only eight of the 63 recommendations made on the 2014 visit had been fully achieved.\n\n\"Instead of making progress, the prison had actually gone backwards, and gone backwards in some very serious and worrying ways,\" he added.\n\nMr Clarke also called for HM Prison and Probation Service to help.\n\nThe report found the prison had a \"complacent and inexcusable\" approach to the safety of vulnerable prisoners.\n\nIt said the prison's city centre location presented a heightened risk of contraband being thrown over the walls - a problem for jails around England and Wales.\n\nIt has repeatedly been identified as a factor behind surging levels of violence in prisons, while there are concerns mobiles are used to facilitate more crime from behind bars.\n\nBut the HMIP noted some \"useful initiatives\" in Swansea to tackle this, including placing staff outside perimeter walls and working with the surrounding community.\n\nAt the time of the inspection, there were 458 men in Swansea prison - nearly 200 more than", "about military matters among much of the public, and the increasing sensitivity to casualties, have all meant that the term \"boots on the ground\" - putting soldiers into harm's way - has become almost toxic.\n\nGeneral Carter has some sympathy with this view.\n\n\"I think the term 'boots on the ground' has become difficult for people to comprehend.\n\n\"The trick of course is for boots on the ground to be applied in a way that is not necessarily risk-free, but is done for appropriate gain and benefit.\"\n\nThis issue of the relationship between Britain and her army is a central aspect of General Carter's thinking.\n\nHe is speaking at an Estonian army base in Tapa, a garrison town a little under 100 miles from the Russian border.\n\nThe general is visiting the British-led multi-national battle group, which is there as part of a Nato deployment to reassure the Estonians and to demonstrate the alliance's cohesion to Moscow.\n\nBritish soldiers took part in a ceremony welcoming the Nato battalion to Estonia earlier this year\n\n\"Young people join an army to be used and that is important to us,\" he says.\n\n\"So the opportunity to do something like we are doing up here in Estonia is important.\n\n\"But we also need to be prepared to be used in other ways as well, providing we can be used in an effective fashion.\"\n\nFor the British army, this is a period of unprecedented change as it transitions away from a dominant focus on counter-insurgency operations in the heat of Iraq and Afghanistan, and re-builds its capability to fight modern high-intensity combat - the sort of conflict it trained for day-in and day-out during the Cold War years.\n\nThe strategic picture is also changing dramatically.\n\nThe potential threats are becoming more complex, the dividing line between peace and war ever less clear.\n\nSome people argue that the modern, Western way of war is at arm's-length - exemplified by armed drones and stand-off weapons fired at great distances from their intended targets.\n\nBy such readings the traditional army - leaving aside maybe the special forces - seems strangely out of step with the apparent new reality.\n\n\"I don't subscribe to the view that we find ourselves in a new era of warfare where you can do it all with stand-off; you can do it all with bombing; you can do it all with special forces and you can do it all with proxies,\" he tells me emphatically.\n\n\"Those are all simply fallacies. The bottom line in all of this is that, in the final analysis, people live on land and it is ultimately the land component that has to 'mix it' where people live. History proves that that is a requirement.\n\n\"Our policy makers absolutely understand that you have an army because, in the final analysis, armies are the business when it comes to a decision, and ultimately it's about a decision.\"\n\nBritain's army is of course an awful lot smaller than it once was.\n\nHow big should it be in part depends upon what the country can afford. So does General Carter think that he has enough soldiers?\n\n\"The straightforward answer to that question is that given the tasks that we have currently got, we have adequate numbers,\" he says.\n\n\"If the tasks change or the tasks increase then we might have to ask questions about it.\"\n\nOn equipment he is confident that the Army will get things that it needs, though \"how quickly it arrives is always a question\".\n\nBut the Army itself is going to change even more dramatically in the years ahead. And this too is something that General Carter is pushing forward.\n\nTraditionally the Army - like most others - is what he terms \"bottom-fed\".\n\nIn other words, \"it recruits people who are youngsters and we grow them through a career\".\n\nBut he believes that as the Army requires and takes on more specialists, it is going to have to offer a very different career structure.\n\n\"I suspect,\" he says, \"that maybe as much as 30% of the army may be specialists in the future - and how we supply those specialist career schemes is something we have to think about.\"\n\nThis could mean a lot more of what the Army calls \"lateral entry\" (ie joining at a much later age, probably from an established career) or indeed sharing people with industry.\n\nNonetheless, at least in his lifetime, General Carter does not expect the combat arms of the Army \"to look particularly different\" to the way they do today.\n\n\"I think we will still deliver that effect through a bottom-fed delivery system in the way that we understand it.\"\n\nBut he says specialists will need to be recruited differently and that will have significant implications requiring a review of ranks, career structures, working practices and so on.\n\nGeneral Carter thinks that the Army is about a year or two away from taking on regular personnel by this lateral entry method.\n\nBut the core business of the Army is not going to change.\n\nWhile its roles go way beyond just training for high-intensity combat, as here in Estonia, it remains part of the nation's insurance policy.\n\nSo being so close to the Russian border, what security challenge does the general worry about most?\n\n\"Probably the greatest risk at the moment,\" he says, \"is the risk of miscalculation.\n\n\"Understanding your potential opponents,\" he says, \"and having the communications systems in place and the processes in place so that you realise what messages you are sending is fundamental.\n\n\"Miscalculation is the thing that we probably need to watch.\"NHS hospital trusts in England may have to recalculate A&E performance figures from last October onwards.\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has told NHS England to explain changes to the recording of A&E data.\n\nIt says the changes - highlighted by BBC News - could have left people reaching \"misleading conclusions\".\n\nThey raise questions over some trusts' performance on the highest profile NHS performance target - that patients in A&E are seen within four hours.\n\nDr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"The changes that are understood to have been made to recording practice throw doubt on whether the scale of the crisis facing emergency medicine - made so clear in December's data - is actually greater than first thought.\"\n\nThe letter focuses on advice given to trusts by the health regulator NHS Improvement.\n\nEd Humpherson, of the UKSA, says changes suggested by officials could \"be having impact on recording practice.\"\n\nThe official target requires 95% of patients to be treated, assessed or discharged within four hours, a figure the NHS has failed to meet since July 2015.\n\nA hospital trust's performance figures include the main accident and emergency department (known as Type 1) and minor injuries or care centres (known as Type 3).\n\nThese centres tend to see and treat patients a lot more quickly than those needing emergency care.\n\nData in these clinics tends to pull up the overall performance of a trust. This is confirmed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.\n\nThe BBC has seen emails sent by NHS Improvement, the body responsible for overseeing trusts, in October last year.\n\nIn one email titled \"counting of A&E performance\" sent to trusts in the south of England, it says they have committed to meeting the 95% target by March 2018 but that trusts had marginally failed to make the required progress.\n\nCan't find your health trust?

Back to search\n\nIf you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.\n\nThe email urged trusts to make sure they counted all their performance.\n\nIt said if \"there is an urgent activity undertaken by a walk-in centre or urgent treatment centre or other provider within your local delivery board that currently is not reporting activity - we can work with you to apportion the activity to the main provider\".\n\nThe implication is that including these centres would help improve overall performance.\n\nThis, and another email sent later in October by NHS Improvement, was seen by trusts as a request to add in data from walk-in centres not run by them and not on hospital grounds.\n\nThis is in direct conflict with clear guidance issued in November 2015 by NHS England, which says walk-in centre data can be included only if the trust has clinical responsibility for the service or if it co-located on the trust's grounds.\n\nAnalysis by the BBC shows as least six trusts in England have seen an improvement in their all A&E types four-hour performance figures in October compared with September by adding in walk-in centres not on their site and not run by the trusts.\n\nIt is thought some trusts have seen their four-hour performance improve by nearly much as 5%.\n\nUniversity Hospitals Coventry and War", "will be - in the words of its headline - \"no more wars like Iraq\".\n\nIt says she was cheered by Republican politicians on Thursday night as she made what the paper sees as \"the biggest shift in UK foreign policy for more than 20 years\".\n\nMrs May, the paper's editorial argues, is \"embracing realism\" in a change that in many ways mirrors that outlined by Donald Trump.\n\n\"May buries Blair doctrine in nod to US,\" is the headline for the Financial Times.\n\nIt believes she was, in some respects, bowing to the inevitable, but notes what it sees as her \"plea to the president\" on the duty of both countries to provide world leadership.\n\nIt says she received rapturous applause after vowing \"no more failed foreign wars\" and welcomes what it calls \"an end to the era of Blair follies\".\n\n\"Let's stand together and halt eclipse of the West\" is the headline for the Times, which believes the main message of the prime minister's speech was urging President Trump not to shirk his \"obligation\" to lead the world.\n\nIt says she also matched parts of Mr Trump's controversial foreign policy, including admitting it was time to engage Russia in the search for peace in Syria.\n\nBut, for the i, Mrs May invoked the \"spirit of the Cold War\", warning the president that the UK and the US needed to engage with the Kremlin from a position of strength.\n\nThe Sun believes her \"radical change of course\" was a \"direct slap-down\" to David Cameron on Libya, as well as to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThere is also much coverage of the prime minister's comment about Mr Trump that \"sometimes, opposites attract\".\n\nFor the Times, Mrs May's response was \"verging on the coquettish\" - acknowledging there are few obvious connections but allowing, it says, for \"the possibility of a spark\".\n\nThe Guardian's editorial cautions it would be naive for her to treat the visit as \"traditional statecraft\" but says it is not impossible she may be able to steer the president towards more balanced approaches - \"she must try\", it says.\n\nThe Financial Times believes her upbeat comments did little to conceal the complexity of developing the special relationship when, it says, she disagrees with Mr Trump on many fundamental issues.\n\nThe Daily Mirror believes her remarks risk enraging millions of women.\n\nIt says it hopes she can secure the best outcome for Britain, without having to get too close to what it calls \"this odious and increasingly offensive leader\".\n\nBut the Sun argues it does not matter what anyone in Britain personally thinks of the new president, even Theresa May; \"her sole duty\", it says, is \"to promote Britain's interests\".\n\nThe Telegraph's cartoonist, Bob, captures \"the special relationship\", as Mr Trump looks into a mirror.\n\nThe i newspaper says the prime minister has \"a superb chance to recast Britain's relationship with America\" and advises that to command Mr Trump's respect she must \"show the forceful confidence of a world leader\".\n\nThe Telegraph reports that Mrs May is preparing to abandon plans for a British Bill of Rights after leaving the EU.\n\nIt quotes government sources as saying plans to scrap the Human Rights Act - already shelved until after Brexit - may now be abandoned entirely, because the sovereignty of British courts will already be significantly strengthened.\n\n\"Corbyn facing MPs' Brexodus\" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, after Tulip Siddiq quit as shadow education minister in response to the Labour leader ordering his MPs to vote to trigger Article 50.\n\nIt says Mr Corbyn is facing a walkout by his frontbench team, while the Mail reports what it calls a \"farcical development\" - the party whip, Thangam Debbonaire, apparently telling MPs she will vote against the bill.\n\nBut, the i says, while the bill has reinforced Labour divisions, several shadow cabinet members known to be worried appear to have fallen in behind Mr Corbyn.\n\nThe lead for the Daily Express is what its headline describes as a \"huge boost\" for pensions.\n\nIt says payouts have surged to their highest level since the financial crisis in 2008, thanks to what the paper calls Britain's Brexit boom.\n\nFor the Daily Mail, the main story is what it calls the new pain threshold test designed to save the NHS millions: denying patients hip or knee replacements unless their pain is so severe they cannot sleep through the night.\n\nIt says three health trusts in the Midlands hope to slash operations by a fifth.\n\nThe Times says \"the latest NHS rationing plans\" come as the number of such operations is increasing by about 8% a year.\n\nThe Times reports that visitors to Britain face the prospect of a tourist tax to stay in popular cities, as councils \"scramble to raise cash to pay for local services\".\n\nThe paper says London Mayor Sadiq Khan will today back charging visitors a hotel levy in a move that could raise tens of millions of pounds for City Hall, and which, if successful, could be replicated up and down the country.\n\nThe British film industry is, according to the Guardian's headline, \"flying high thanks to Superman and Star Wars\".\n\nThey are among 200 movies that began shooting in the UK last year, 48 of which were funded overseas with a total spend of \u00a31.6bn.\n\nThe i points out that the three most successful films in 2016 were made here: Rogue One, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Bridget Jones's Baby.\n\nAnd finally, a study about canine musical tastes produces a panoply of puns.\n\n\"Pooch-ini? Bach?\" asks the Mail, \"no, your dog would rather listen to reggae.\"\n\nThe Telegraph says the research by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Glasgow University suggests they prefer music \"with a little more bite\", with soft rock also said to make dogs calmer and more relaxed.\n\nThe i, which dubs them \"Super woofers\", says the charity now intends to install sound systems at all its kennels.Labour's Brexit bind is not hard to grasp.\n\nThe vast majority of Labour MPs campaigned to keep Britain in the EU. But most now represent constituencies that voted to leave.\n\nAnd as Parliament prepares to vote on triggering divorce talks with Brussels, Labour MPs are being ordered to approve the start of Brexit by a party leader who spent his backbench career ignoring similar demands for discipline.\n\nThese are agonising days for a parliamentary party struggling to maintain a coherent position on the biggest issue facing British politics for a generation.\n\nLet's start with Jeremy Corbyn's decision to impose what, in parliamentary parlance, is called a three-line whip.\n\nAs far as the political parties in Westminster are concerned, MPs are not sent to Parliament to carefully weigh up each issue and vote according to their own judgement or conscience.\n\nNo, they are there to vote as their party leadership tells them to. Over the weekend, all MPs will receive a letter from their party's whips office telling them how to vote on various Bills before the Commons next week.\n\nArticle 50 of the Lisbon treaty sets out how countries can leave the EU.\n\nThe most important by far will be the Second Reading of the bill to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nIt will not be the end of the parliamentary process for the Bill (a Committee stage will follow the week after and the Lords needs to approve it too) but it's a big moment.\n\nAnd in the letter Labour MPs will receive, the name of the bill will be underlined three times. That means they must vote as their party managers instruct - no ifs, no buts.\n\nIn this case, they must vote to support the government's plan to trigger Article 50 by the end of March.\n\nIt's an instruction that gives Labour MPs no wiggle-room or freedom to vote according to their conscience. Of course, Labour MPs can choose to ignore the instruction but for backbenchers that would normally mean a big black mark against their name by the party whips and for front benchers such insubordination would mean resignation or the sack.\n\nSo why has Mr Corbyn decided to issue a three-line whip on Article 50?\n\nFirst, he has made it clear Labour will respect the result of the referendum and not block the start of Brexit in Parliament. Mr Corbyn believes", "it comes to the Lakeside. I'm dead happy.\n\n\"I don't think I've had a better feeling in darts.\"\n\nDurrant won the first set and the next three also went with the throw, before Waites broke to go 3-2 up with checkouts of 20, 104 and 45.\n\nFrom there, however, Durrant found another level, winning the next five sets to take home the winners' cheque.\n\n\"I am gutted about losing. Glen didn't give me much chance after the break,\" said Waites, winner in 2013 and 2016.\n\n\"That's why he's champion and I'm not.

The exact cause of his death is unknown.\n\nThe city councillor was a popular local figure and had been eight months into his term of office.\n\nCouncil leader Lewis Herbert said he served \"with distinction and panache\".\n\nA keen scuba diver and underwater photographer, Mr Gawthrope was on holiday at a diving resort near Durban with his wife, Jenny.\n\nMr Gawthrope was a prolific charity fundraiser and worked at the Cambridge University Press, Judge Business School - and latterly as a porter at Clare College, Cambridge.\n\nHe was particularly proud of his association with the Cambridge children's charity, the Red Hen Project.\n\nHe was also a long-standing member of the Unite union and acted as a representative and delegate.\n\nMr Gawthrope was elected to Cambridge City Council serving King's Hedges ward for Labour in 2012 - and again in 2016 - before taking up the mayoral role in May.\n\nMr Herbert, leader of the city's 26 Labour councillors, said: \"Our thoughts and emotions are with his wife Jenny so far away, and with Nigel's family and close friends at this truly horrible time.\n\n\"As a councillor and mayor of Cambridge, Nigel served with distinction and panache.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nigel was a one-off. He was a thoroughly engaging individual who will be hard to replace.\"\n\nEast of England MEP Alex Mayer said Mr Gawthrope was a \"committed ward councillor... who always greeted you with a smile\" and described the news as \"deeply, deeply sad\".\n\nLabour councillor Kevin Price said he and Mr Gawthrope \"shared a history of trades union activism within the printing industry\".\n\n\"He loved representing the ward where he grew up,\" he added, \"and many residents in the ward will share our deep shock and sadness at his untimely death.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Although there were clashes around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, there was not the same kind of violence seen in recent protests\n\nThousands of demonstrators turned out across France for new \"yellow vests\" protests, with dozens of arrests and clashes in Paris and other cities.\n\nPolice in the capital used water cannon and tear gas as scuffles broke out at the Arc de Triomphe, on the ninth consecutive weekend of protests.\n\nSome 84,000 demonstrators were recorded nationwide, an increase compared with last week, official figures show.\n\nThe nationwide protests were initially triggered by the rising price of fuel.\n\nThey have since widened to include anger at the cost of living, with a wide-ranging list of other demands.\n\nThousands of officers were deployed across Paris, which has previously seen street clashes and vandalism, to tackle the protesters, and parts of the city centre were blocked off by riot police.\n\nSome 8,000 demonstrators were on the streets - more than in the past two weekends, when authorities counted just 3,500 people on 5 January and 800 on 29 December, according to interior ministry figures.\n\nSome 156 protesters were arrested, and as of 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT), 108 remained in custody, police said.\n\nBy nightfall, there had not been the looting or burning of cars as seen in previous weeks.\n\nSkirmishes also broke out in cities around the country, including Bordeaux\n\nThere were also thousands of protesters in the cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse in southern France as well as Strasbourg in the east and the central city of Bourges, the site of another major rally, where more than 6,000 people took to the streets.\n\nNationwide, 244 people were arrested, of which 201 remained in custody, police said.\n\nSome 80,000 police officers were deployed nationwide to face the protesters.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said a national debate is due to kick off on 15 January in response to weeks of protests by the \"gilets jaunes\" - so-called because of the high-visibility jackets they wear.\n\nIt will be held publicly in town halls across France and on the internet, and will focus on four themes: taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship.The driver of a dark-coloured VW car is being hunted after the crash early on Saturday\n\nA woman has been killed in a suspected hit-and-run crash in south London.\n\nThe victim, aged in her 20s, was struck by a car \"travelling at speed\" on Brixton Hill in the early hours, the Met said.\n\nDetectives are hunting the driver of a dark-coloured VW - possibly a Golf - after the crash at about 00:30 GMT, at the junction with New Park Road.\n\nParamedics tried to revive the woman but she was declared dead at the scene.\n\nThe Met said the woman was struck by a car \"travelling at speed\"\n\n\"The driver of the vehicle, which was travelling at speed, did not stop at the scene and inquiries are under way to trace it,\" the Met said.\n\nThe force added the car might have a damaged bonnet.\n\nAn appeal for witnesses has been issued.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.The venue provided promotional images of the production which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham panto\n\nA venue that put on a \"spectacularly bad\" pantomime has offered a refund to all customers who paid to see it.\n\nJack and the Beanstalk at Chippenham's Neeld Community and Arts Centre was billed as boasting a \"sparkling set and glittering costumes\".\n\nBut one disgruntled punter said: \"There were only three people, no scenery, they couldn't sing or dance.\"\n\nThe town council, which runs the venue, said it \"was not the standard of show the Neeld is used to presenting\".\n\nThe company behind the show, OOOH ARRR Productions, said there had been a \"booking error\" and it had received a \"handful of complaints\" but had agreed a full refund with the venue.\n\nThe show ran from 27-29 December, and was sold out, with standard tickets priced at \u00a37.00.\n\nPosting on the 158-seat venue's Facebook page, ticket-buyer Natalie Uff described the panto as \"awful\".\n\n\"At one point they were talking to voices in the wings as they ran out of people,\" she said.\n\nAnother panto fan, Tereza Cleverley, said: \"It was spectacularly bad.

It is that stark.\n\nThe mood at the march was determinedly cheerful, there were men, children and lots and lots of women. Grandmothers teaching their granddaughters the political ropes.\n\nBut the underlying message was clear - liberal America has just been shoved out of power.\n\nThese marches were enormous and they came out in cities across the country to repudiate not just Donald Trump, but his whole world view.\n\nThey didn't just protest about women's issues, there were also signs addressing his positions on climate change, healthcare and Muslims.\n\nCan they change President Trump's agenda? Probably not.\n\nBut approval ratings matter - they are a form of political capital and when this many people really dislike the new president, that makes it harder for him to persuade members of Congress to support him on difficult issues.\n\nThe polls show us that Mr Trump is the most unpopular new president in American history. Those are the facts.\n\nThese marches put faces to those numbers.Coverage: Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January.\n\nNovak Djokovic and Andy Murray have so much shared history.\n\nAnd now, in the space of just four days in Melbourne, the world's top two players have both been on the receiving end of upsets almost without parallel in the past 10 years.\n\nFormer players were cheering Mischa Zverev on from the locker room - not because of any antipathy towards Murray, but because his opponent was playing the style of tennis many of them used to play to great effect.\n\nServing and volleying against the Briton seems counter-intuitive. Along with Djokovic, he is the best returner in the world - and if he does not manage to pass you, then he is more than likely to send a top spin lob fizzing over your head to within inches of the baseline.\n\nBut Zverev served superbly, and volleyed even better, again and again and again. The German hit some astonishing returns and made short shrift of Murray's second serve. And when the pressure started to rise, his level did not start to fall.\n\nPinned behind the baseline too frequently for comfort, Murray started missing more regularly. The Scot was unable to turn the tide or summon up the aggression that served him so well in the second half of last season.\n\u2022 None Has Djokovic's obsession burnt itself out?\n\nAndre Agassi addressed this subject before the match. The four-time Australian Open champion was very complimentary about Murray in a video link to Melbourne Park on Saturday, as he explained how the 29-year-old could improve still further.\n\n\"I have always sort of talked about Andy as a person that has never really utilised his game to his maximum potential. He's so good at certain things that it almost makes him a bit indecisive,\" Agassi said.\n\n\"If you actually minimised his defensive skills just 5%, he might even actually be a better player.\n\n\"He puts himself through unnecessary wear and tear on a court, because his offensive upside is, I think, still more than he shows.\"\n\nMurray says he will now reflect on whether he could have done anything differently to prepare for the first Grand Slam of the year. He only had time for two weeks off after a frenetic end to last season, and must now balance the need for rest with his instinctive desire to play in Great Britain's Davis Cup first-round tie in Canada the week after next.\n\nMurray suggested in the immediate aftermath of defeat that he intends to play in Ottawa, but his coaching team may well argue he should take a longer break before heading to Dubai in late February. The first two Masters events of the year follow in Indian Wells and Miami.\n\nThere is no immediate threat to Murray's world number one ranking - he will be 1,715 points ahead of Serb Djokovic when the list is refreshed at the end of the Australian Open.\n\nHe is certain to be number one until at least May because he has just a handful of ranking points to defend between now and the start of the clay court season.\n\nCan anything further be read into the early exits of both Murray and Djokovic, who will both have turned 30 by the time the next Grand Slam is staged at Roland Garros in four months?\n\nAgeing players are once again doing very well at this Australian Open, with half of the 12 men left in the draw on Sunday night older than the pair of them.\n\nAnd yet in the modern era, men have found it tricky to win Grand Slam titles in their thirties. Stan Wawrinka and Agassi have each done it twice, but even Roger Federer has managed it only once.\n\nMats Wilander, who won the last of his seven Grand Slam titles at the age of 24, explains why it can become harder to find the consistency required over seven rounds.\n\n\"You have good days and you have bad days when you get older,\" Wilander told BBC Sport.\n\n\"You don't have to call on anything when you are younger - it's just there naturally. You don't worry about the consequences, you just play and you fight until the bitter end. I think the mind gets in your way when you get older.\"\n\nThere are still three Grand Slam champions left in the draw, with Federer, Wawrinka and Rafael Nadal all now over 30. The younger challenge is led by Milos Raonic, Dominic Thiem and Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nAlong with Federer - who will not now have to face Murray in the quarter-finals - it may be Raonic who takes most heart from Sunday's events.\n\nYou will not find him at the net as often as Zverev, but he did add the 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek to his team in December with the explicit intention of trying", ".\n\n\"The likelihood is that, because of its location, most of the early landlords were connected with horses, carriages and stabling,\" writes Dailey.\n\nThe pub's main bar - with its 150-year-old Chelsea pottery beer engine pump handles - is unusually low, with short stools in front.\n\nThis is because the floor of the bar servery is positioned midway between the main bar and the lower back bar to the rear, which was once possibly a stables or courtyard.\n\nThe Nags Head is also filled with dozens of toys, penny arcade machines, posters and photos - and the current landlord's collection of military memorabilia.\n\nThe Blackfriar - built in 1875 - stands on the site of London's Dominican friary in the parish of Ludgate.\n\nThe Dominicans are known as \"the blackfriars\" because of the black cloaks they wear.\n\nIn the early 20th Century the pub's interior was remodelled by the sculptor Henry Poole, who created a vision straight out of medieval England.\n\nThere is a sumptuous mosaic ceiling, with marble columns and copper clay friezes.\n\nAnd black-cloaked friars can be spotted just about everywhere - all appearing to enjoy sins of overindulgence.\n\nThe interior of the French House looks more like a Parisian backstreet bar, than a traditional London pub - and it remains a favourite of artists, writers, actors and photographers,\n\nGeorge Dailey describes the inside as \"a little tired, faintly bohemian - but with unmistakeable Gallic charm\".\n\nFor most of the 20th Century the pub's official name was The York Minster.\n\nIts metamorphosis into \"The French\" started in 1914, when its German owner sold the business to a Belgian - but \"The French sounds more romantic\", says Dailey.\n\nThe inn on this site was first built in 1520 - on the north bank of the Thames to the east of the City.\n\nIt would have been a timber structure surrounded by gardens and marshland. It was rebuilt in the 18th Century.\n\nRegular visitors included the writers Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and Samuel Johnson - and the venue was known for its bare-knuckle and cock fights.\n\nIt's thought the pub's strange name derives from the fact that a collier - a ship carrying coal - from Whitby in North Yorkshire used to moor regularly beside the pub.\n\nInitially it was just called The Prospect.\n\nFor people heading to London from the south, Borough High Street in Southwark was a terminus.\n\nThe walled City of London was only a bridge away, but it was closed at night.\n\nLatecomers were forced to take rooms at one of the local inns - including The George.\n\nThe George became a home for political debate and gossip - and Shakespeare's plays were often performed in its courtyard.\n\nAccording to Dailey: \"There is no pub in London that can boast of having a completely untouched 18th Century interior - but The George comes very close.\"\n\nThe current building, which backs on to the shore of the Thames, dates from 1720 - built on the site of a previous pub, which burned down in 1710.\n\nIn 1865, Charles Dickens is thought to have written about The Grapes - or The Bunch of Grapes, as it was then known.\n\nHe describes \"a tavern of dropsical appearance... long settled down into a state of hale infirmity. It had outlasted many a sprucer public house, indeed the whole house impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver, who has paused so long on the brink, that he will never go in at all.\"\n\nAlthough rebuilt in the 1920s, there has probably been a pub on the site of The Ship since the mid-16th Century - and in its early incarnation it was known as a haven for persecuted Catholics.\n\nThe pub is now just behind a busy underground station, but initially it would have overlooked a rough area of pasture land - Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nThis narrow pub on the Thames is one of the best places to watch the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race - if you can find a space to stand.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests the Dove was actually a licensed pub as early as 1730 - when the green fields and orchards of 18th Century Hammersmith offered tranquillity away from the City of London, which was then only a two-hour coach ride away.\n\nWith all the hallmarks of a village inn, The Flask is very close to Highgate Cemetery - the burial place of Karl Marx.\n\nIt also claims to have two ghosts - a Spanish barmaid who took her life when the landlord rejected her amorous advances, and a hapless man dressed as a cavalier who crosses the main bar and disappears into a wall.\n\nThe poets Byron, Shelley, Keats and Coleridge were regular drinkers here. Coleridge believed the clean air on the hill at Highgate was beneficial in his attempts to cure himself of opium addiction.\n\nWhen the building now known as The Lamb and Flag was built, in the mid-17th Century, Covent Garden was a relatively new urban area - a smart and desirable address.\n\nBut a century later, the gentry had moved away and the area had become a red-light district. Records from 1772 show that The Lamb and Flag - or Coopers Arms as it was known then - was trading successfully, but the clientele was drawn from the lower levels of society.\n\nA century later, and the venue was a popular location for unlicensed bare-knuckle fights.\n\nGreat Pubs of London by George Dailey is published by Prestel.Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of David Bowie's death\n\nEach specialism within journalism has its area of breaking news.\n\nFor foreign correspondents, it tends to be a conflict or catastrophe.

It was a producer at the Today programme.\n\nHad I heard the news, he asked? M\u2026maybe - I hedged. What news? David Bowie is dead, he said.\n\nOh no! Oh no for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was awful news. I loved David Bowie; couldn't imagine him dead. He was still making great records. He wasn't particularly old, and now - well - he was no longer here.\n\nAnd then, oh no - I had to make sense of his incredible life, without much time to pause for thought. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today's Nick Robinson.\n\nI got home late from work that night, put Heroes on and thought\u2026 sad day, but thankfully rare - a once-a-year occasion at worst.\n\nBut three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news\u2026?\n\nOh dear.

After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account\n\n\"Some of that content is shocking in that it encourages self harm, it links self-harm to suicide and I have no doubt that Instagram helped kill my daughter.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook executive Steve Hatch responded, saying: \"The first thing I'd like to say is just what a difficult story it was to read and I, like anyone, was deeply upset.\n\n\"I'm deeply sorry for how this must have been such a devastating event for their family.\"\n\nWhen confronted with print-outs of Instagram posts showing graphic photos of self-harm, he said: \"We'd have to make sure that we look at these and ensure that those are taken down if they are against our policies.\n\n\"If people are posting in order to seek help and in order to seek support from communities, the experts in this area tell us that is a valuable thing for them to do.

Dorset Police on Thursday night confirmed the 28-year-old's body had been recovered from the wreckage, which was found on Sunday morning.\n\nThis is an updated version of a story first published on 22 January.\n\nEmiliano Sala, whose death in a light aircraft crash at the age of 28 has been announced, was born in Santa Fe, Argentina - but it was in France that he forged his reputation.\n\nAmong the top five goalscorers in Ligue 1 this season, Sala netted 12 times at better than a goal every two games.\n\nThat prompted Cardiff to pay Nantes a club record \u00a315m for a man who spent his entire professional career in the French leagues.\n\nSala was born on 31 October 1990 in the small rural community of Cululu in the Santa Fe province, about 340 miles north west of Buenos Aires.\n\nAfter progressing through the youth set-up at Argentine side Club Proyecto Crecer, he moved to France to sign for Bordeaux.\n\nBut, after making his debut as a 21-year-old, he struggled for game time and a series of loan moves followed.\n\nHe spent the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons at US Orleans and Niort respectively, scoring 37 goals in 74 matches.\n\nWhen he took that goalscoring form into a loan spell with Caen in 2015, Nantes had seen enough - and bought the 6ft 3in striker for a reported one million euros.\n\nThree and a half years - and 42 goals later - came Premier League interest.\n\nWest Ham, Everton, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Southampton were all linked with Sala, but it was Cardiff who got their man - eclipsing the \u00a311m they paid for Gary Medel to sign him.\n\nWhen his signing was announced, Sala said: \"It gives me great pleasure and I can't wait to start training, meet my new team-mates and get down to work.\"\n\nIn a later tweet, he wrote: \"I know the challenge is big, but together we will make it.\"\n\nTwo days later he posted a picture of him and his former Nantes team-mates.

Pilot for new parent MPs to vote by proxy\n\nMPs on parental leave will be able to nominate another MP to vote on their behalf if new plans announced by the government are agreed.\n\nProxy voting in Parliament has long been discussed for pregnant MPs and new parents, but despite widespread agreement, it has not come into force.\n\nAndrea Leadsom said if the House voted in favour of the scheme next Monday, a year-long pilot would take place.\n\nIt comes after an article accused the Tory chief whip of blocking the change.\n\n\"Multiple sources\" told the Times that Julian Smith had been trying to stop it from being allowed while trying to get the Theresa May's Brexit deal through Parliament.\n\nThe article led to Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson asking an urgent question in the House of Commons about the progress of enabling proxy voting.\n\nShe previously accused the Tories of breaking a \"pairing\" agreement with her when she was on maternity leave.\n\nThe pairing system should have seen one MP not voting to cancel out Ms Swinson's absence, but the MP she was paired with - Tory chairman Brandon Lewis - still voted. He has since apologised for an \"honest mistake\" by whips.\n\nThe issue of proxy voting was raised again during last week's crunch Brexit votes on Mrs May's deal as a heavily pregnant Labour MP, Tulip Siddiq, chose to delay her Caesarean by two days and was pushed through the voting lobby in a wheelchair as proxy voting was not available. She said she did not trust the pairing system after Ms Swinson's experience.\n\nMs Swinson welcomed the government announcement but said it \"gives a whole new meaning to being overdue\".\n\n\"Some have been dragged kicking and screaming to this position,\" she said.\n\n\"We have waited long enough for this change. Modernising the House of Commons is a slow and laborious process and often quite like childbirth. Let's get on with it.\"\n\nWhen a vote is held in the House of Commons, the speaker asks MPs to call out whether they are for or against the bill. If there is not a clear winner, he calls a vote, known as a division.\n\nMPs then go into one of the two rooms at the end of the Commons chamber - the division lobbies - and have to walk through to cast their vote.\n\nPairing: If members cannot get to Parliament to vote, they can enter an informal agreement known as \"pairing\". This means an MP from the opposing side of the absent politician agrees not to vote so the numbers are cancelled out.\n\nNodding through: Another method is known as \"nodding through\". This means someone's vote can be counted even if they cannot pass through one of the lobbies - as long as they are somewhere on the parliamentary estate. It is traditionally used for people who are too unwell to walk - in the past MPs have voted by being in the back of an ambulance which was driven in and out of the gates.\n\nBut it has been used on a small number of occasions in recent years for people with childcare commitments as a result of Lib Dem Jenny Willott negotiating the right in 2011 after the birth of her son Toby.\n\nProxy voting: This will allow MPs who are heavily pregnant or are on parental leave to nominate another MP to cast their votes. Recommendations from the procedure committee say that the name of the MP nominated to act as the proxy should be published and any changes to the arrangement would require a notice period.\n\nMrs Leadsom thanked the Lib Dem MP for her campaigning over the issue and agreed that she wanted to make Parliament \"a more modern workplace\".\n\nShe said the pilot would follow plans set out by the cross-party procedure committee, who recommended last year that new parents should be allowed to notify the House of Commons about a specified period of absence - up to six months for mothers and two weeks for fathers - and nominate a member to cast votes on their behalf for that period.\n\nAfter the pilot year, the scheme would then be reviewed.\n\n\"This is a perfect example of how parliament can work collaboratively to bring about important change,\" Mrs Leadsom added.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

What is it like inside Guantanamo Bay?\n\nThese are uncertain times at Guantanamo Bay. Not only for the detainees but also those who guard them. After eight years in which President Obama has tried - and failed - to close the detention facility, what will President Trump mean for its future?\n\nThe first detainees arrived at Camp X-Ray 15 years ago in the early months of what was then called the \"War on Terror\". I first visited a few weeks later and watched the men in orange jumpsuits in steel cages in the hot Cuban sun.\n\nGuantanamo had been chosen partly because it was not US soil and so avoided coming under regular US law. The camp then had a thrown together feel - the Bush administration was improvising and no-one was sure how long it would last.\n\nThe orange jumpsuits worn by detainees became notorious\n\nThe next time I visited - two years later - Camp X-Ray had been replaced by the more permanent structure of Camp Delta. Guantanamo was here to stay.\n\nIts numbers grew - around 700 at its peak. But on his second day in office eight years ago President Obama promised to close the facility and the pace of transfers increased.\n\nOn my visit a few weeks ago, I found much of the Camp eerily empty, a lone iguana roaming around the barbed wire. But closing Guantanamo was a promise President Obama could not keep, partly because Congress blocked the transfer of any detainees to the US.\n\nFewer than 60 men are now left. There are 20 currently cleared for release and the Obama administration is trying to transfer some of these out before its term ends.\n\nBut on 3 January, President-elect Trump made his views clear in a tweet.\n\n\"There should be no further releases,\" he wrote. \"These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back on to the battlefield.\"\n\nMost of the remaining detainees are held now in Camp Six.\n\nInside a cell in Camp Six at Guantanamo Bay\n\nThe uncertainty hanging over the base was clear as we toured the detention block. We were able to watch and film detainees in the communal areas of their cell block through one-way glass, an unsettling procedure.\n\nThe detainees are not supposed to know we are there but clearly they realised as one put up a hand-painted sign showing a question mark with a padlock underneath.\n\nThey followed the election result like everyone else and Col Steve Gabavics, Commander of the Joint Detention Force, told me: \"They were all watching TV - their behaviour was pretty much the same as any other night.\n\n\"We didn't notice any significant negative response. No-one came to us angry, no-one protested. They were simply interested to see what was going to happen.\"\n\nColonel Steve Gabavics said they noticed no reaction to Donald Trump's election victory\n\nOne difference from my early visits is just how much more controlled - even mundane - the interaction between detainees and guards is now compared to the early days.\n\nThe attacks of 2001 were still raw and there was a tension and sense of underlying aggression on both sides. Now, the atmosphere is much more controlled.\n\nDetainees tap on a window to summon a guard when they have a message to pass and the guard proceeds through a door into a cage-like structure inside the cell-block where they can communicate with a detainee.\n\nDuring our visit in December, officials say that the detainees were \"compliant\".\n\nBut what does the arrival of President Trump mean?\n\n\"You know the detainees have questions - are the transfers going to stop when the new president takes office on 20 January? We don't know, they don't know. Their lawyers may speculate, but no-one knows,\" says Rear Adm Peter Clarke, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo.\n\nHe did say - before Donald Trump's latest tweet - that \"some of them may act up\" if they realise they are not going to be transferred.\n\nSomewhere else on the base, which sprawls across an otherwise isolated tip of Cuba, is Camp Seven. Its precise location is secret - leading to much speculation from visiting reporters.\n\nThis is where so-called high value detainees are being held - men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks who is going through the long slow process of a military commission - a form of trial.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and sent to the US detention centre in Cuba in 2006\n\nMight it be not only that transfers out are stopped, but that current detainees find they have some company?\n\n\"We are going to load it up with bad dudes,\" Mr Trump said in the campaign trail in February last year.\n\nCamp Five was built to hold detainees but now sits empty. What if President Trump decides he wants to not just stop people", "Scott, or even spend time in the same room as him. She suffers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, a rare disorder of the immune system, which means she is allergic to almost everything, including her husband's scent.\n\nJohanna and Scott Watkins's date nights are very different from other couples.\n\n\"Scott and I will try to watch a show together. We can't be in the room together, because I'm allergic to him, but he will be three floors below me in a room on his laptop and I will be on mine and we'll watch the show at the same time and then text about it as we're watching it,\" says Johanna.\n\nJohanna lives in an attic room all by herself with sealed windows and doors, and air filters to purify the air. She has a severe form of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in which the cells that are meant to protect her from outside threats mutate and start attacking her body instead.\n\nOn their wedding day the couple were unaware Johanna's condition would become so severe\n\nThe symptoms and severity of the disease can vary from patient to patient, but it makes Johanna allergic to virtually everything and can trigger life-threatening anaphylactic shock.\n\nBefore she married her husband Scott in 2013 Johanna did not expect her condition to become so severe. She worked as a teacher and the couple used to love hiking together. Even then she struggled with unusual rashes, irritable bowel syndrome and migraines, but these ailments became much worse after the couple married.\n\n\"There were times three and four years ago, before we got the diagnosis, that if I was extra close to my wife, specifically if my face was close to Johanna's face, she would cough,\" says Scott.\n\nBut it was only last year that the couple realised they had become unable to physically share their life together.\n\n\"We had noticed that when Scott would come in [to the room] I would start feeling worse and worse. My normal daily symptoms would just be aggravated,\" says Johanna. \"And then at one point he went to get his haircut and came back in the room and within two minutes I had started my anaphylactic symptoms and he had to leave.\"\n\nA week later Scott tried to see his wife again, but the same thing happened, and they realised their lives would have to change dramatically.\n\n\"It was this horrible reality that it wasn't going to work,\" says Johanna. \"I was now reacting strongly to my husband. Before this I had reacted to my parents, to many, many other people, but it was horrific when it became Scott.\"\n\nThe treatment and medication that is usually given to MCAS sufferers does not help Johanna, so at the moment the couple do not know when - if ever - their situation will change.\n\n\"There's not an easy way around this problem. I want to keep Johanna safe and me going to see her compromises her safety,\" says Scott. \"One of the ways I can take care of her now is by not going to see her. I'm not going to endanger her life. We're absolutely committed to one another and we're going to wait as long as it takes to see if there is some kind of healing.\"\n\nDoctors are trying different treatments, but none so far have helped.\n\n\"They don't know if I will get well, and so we hope and we pray that I will,\" says Johanna. \"I have had anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction, more times than we can keep track of. My life could end quickly. Life is frail - it can end.\"\n\nBut Scott will be part of her life for as long as it continues, she says.\n\n\"On our wedding day we made vows to each other that till death do us part. No matter what life brought.\n\n\"I can tell you that even if I have this until I'm 90 years old, I would be committed to my husband with that vow and still love him.\"\n\nJohanna and Scott are no longer able to hold each other's hands\n\nScott says they do sometimes get angry and frustrated about their situation.\n\n\"I've had to release a lot of what I expected for myself and I've had to accept what has been given to us,\" says Scott.\n\nHe adds: \"Johanna and I are good at talking, we talk a lot, we try to communicate a lot, so one thing that we've found that's helpful is just bringing each other into what's going on in our lives as best we can because we're not able to be together.\"\n\nScott works full-time as a teacher and then returns home every evening to cook Johanna's food.\n\n\"It's one of the ways that I can care for her, and every other day for the past year I've had one of my dear friends come and they help [me] cook for Johanna,\" he says. \"She can only eat two meals, so she's been eating the same two meals for over a year.\"\n\nJohanna can only tolerate 15 different foods, including spices, so she eats either beef chuck roast (beef stew) with organic celery, carrot and parsnip or organic lamb with turmeric, cinnamon and cucumber.\n\nJohanna has not responded to any treatment so far, including four rounds of chemotherapy\n\nThe couple are currently living in the family home of their friends, the Olsons, while their own home is renovated to make it a safe living space for Johanna. The Olson family have given up using all scented products and do not cook in their house at all.\n\n\"I have had severe reactions to someone smoking a cigarette down the block,\" says Johanna. \"I have had severe reactions to the pizza place that's a mile down the street, and all my windows are closed and sealed in the room with special filters.\n\n\"But just if the wind blows it on the right direction that day and I get even a whiff I can have a severe reaction. The house is quite large and I'm at the top level, and if an onion were to be cut in the kitchen I have had a severe reaction.\"\n\nJohanna has not left the attic room for more than a year, except to visit the hospital in an emergency or to see her doctor. Every morning she listens to a playlist of songs and then might write or answer an email to a friend, or video-call her young nieces.\n\nThe only people she does not have a life-threatening reaction to are her siblings, who help take care of her.

from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example.\n\nBut lawyers for the mothers said a problem arises when claimants are paid by employers on a date which \"clashes\" with their assessment period.\n\nFor example, they pointed out that if a claimant is paid early because of a weekend or bank holiday, the system counts them as having been paid twice in one month and they receive a \"vastly reduced\" universal credit payment.\n\nThis is an important and potentially hugely expensive decision.\n\nThe barrister for the DWP told the High Court in November that if they lost the case it would cost them hundreds of millions of pounds to change the system.\n\nLeaked documents that I saw in October showed officials discussing the problem but concluding that \"there is nothing we can do to mitigate this issue\".\n\nAt the heart of the problem is a design fault with universal credit that cuts the entitlement of tens of thousands of claimants each month, sometimes by hundreds of pounds.\n\nThe court's decision was published just minutes before Amber Rudd started her speech today, billed as a reset of the beleaguered benefit.\n\nShe didn't mention this particular problem, but it highlights that Ms Rudd's remarks can only be the starting point in dealing with Universal Credit's ongoing problems.\n\nUniversal credit merges six older benefits into one new one, and is being introduced gradually across the UK. Instead of applying for lots of different payments, for different things, one payment is calculated based on all of someone's circumstances, like:\n\u2022 having an illness or disability It can be claimed by people both in and out of work. How much someone in work claiming universal credit receives each month is based on how much they earned in the previous month. And unlike with some old benefits, there's no limit to the hours someone can work per week and still claim. But as they earn more, their benefit payment reduces gradually. This is designed to mean \"work always pays\" - that is, in theory someone never loses more in benefits than they have gained through taking extra hours of work. Some households will receive less money from universal credit than they would have done under the old system, while others will receive more. This is partly down to the intentional design of the system and partly a side-effect of cuts that have been made as the benefit was introduced.\n\nThe two judges in London concluded the work and pensions secretary had \"wrongly interpreted\" the relevant regulations.\n\nMs Gregory called for Ms Rudd to take \"immediate steps to ensure that no other claimants are adversely affected\" and \"ensure all those who have suffered because of this unlawful conduct are swiftly and fairly compensated\".\n\nThe leader of the trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, also called for the government to \"compensate those who have lost out substantially\".\n\nShadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the High Court's ruling \"confirms once again that universal credit is failing people on low pay\", and called for a stop to the rollout.\n\nRebecca Smidmore told the BBC she felt \"made to feel bad\" for claiming benefits\n\nRebecca Smidmore, a carer for her 10-year-old son who has spina bifida, said her family's universal credit payments vary hugely each month - for example, if her husband gets paid a day or two early when payday falls at a weekend.\n\n\"They then think he's been paid twice in a month and universal credit is then altered,\" she said. \"So some months we get a really low amount, some months we get a really high amount.\"\n\nShe said universal credit had a \"massive impact really early on\" and makes budgeting difficult, adding: \"It's as if we are made to feel bad that we are claiming this benefit, that we don't deserve this money\".\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to the BBC's Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt, Ms Rudd announced she favoured calls to change the way people who are on universal credit, but starting to go back to work, are taxed.\n\nMs Rudd told the programme: \"I would like every incentive we can find to make sure that people going back into work realise that it is the best thing for them and that they don't get a huge 90% tax rate.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Ms Rudd promised to make the universal credit system more \"individual\" and tailor it to claimants needs, for example by making payments more regular.\n\nChanges will also see more money go directly to women who are the \"main carer\" in a family, in response to criticism that the \"one payment per household\" system penalised women.\n\nCharities have argued a whole family's benefit payments often go to the man's account and women, particularly victims of domestic violence, have little or no access to it.\n\nMs Rudd also announced a U-turn on plans to extend a benefits cap on families with more than two children.\n\nThe cap will no longer apply to about 15,000 families, who had their children before the two-child limit was introduced in 2017.\n\u2022 None Universal"]

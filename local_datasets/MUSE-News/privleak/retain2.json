["a bit saintly - he wasn't. He was great fun. He could be a witty and sometimes hilarious raconteur - with a gift for sometimes merciless mimicry. And like all of us, he enjoyed a bit of intrigue and gossip.\n\nGeorge never shied away from complex stories - he went to meet his former Rwandan interpreter in prison\n\nThere is a word in the Nguni languages of Southern Africa that was, I think, George's lodestar. He spoke about it at a party to celebrate his 60th birthday in 2015: Ubuntu. It expresses the idea that human beings are bound together in a shared responsibility for each other.\n\nGeorge and I both interviewed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who'd helped end South Africa's racist system of white-minority rule. He defined Ubuntu like this: \"I am me because you are you. I can never be free while you are enslaved. I can never be rich while you are poor. We two are connected.\"\n\nA young George, in striped top, at school in Ghana\n\nGeorge had been a migrant twice by the age of 11. Born in Sri Lanka, moved to Ghana and then to a boarding school in England.\n\nAdapting to new cultures and thriving were formative experiences. And it planted in him something that was also key to his talent: he could see how the world looked from the point of view of the Global South - the view from Africa and Asia especially - and convey that perspective to the living rooms of the globally prosperous.\n\nHe later went back to visit his old school\n\nGeorge would never have made such a claim for himself. Off screen he was funny, clever, entertaining, a generous friend and confidant. I told him once that the pan in companion came from the Latin word for bread, that the word carried in it the ingrained human desire to break bread with those we love and care about. He laughed and said, \"How do you know these ridiculous things?\" But I have had some of the richest experiences of companionability and conviviality at George's table, breaking bread.\n\nFor George was also full of a kind of energetic hope. There was something infectious about his optimism. You always walked away from time with George liking the human race more, feeling better about the world.\n\nHe brought that cheerful disposition to his cancer diagnosis. I rang him when I heard the news. \"It's much worse than the public statement implies, Allan,\" he confided. \"But I have great doctors.\"\n\nYears later, when the cancer had returned and we knew it would never go away, I sat with him in the garden of the London home he shared with Frances, his wife of 40 years. \"I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"There's no point in that. The only thing I find unbearably painful is the idea of Frances being left here on her own.\"\n\nGeorge dreaded having to leave his wife Frances behind\n\nAlways that in George. Others before self. I saw him one last time shortly before he died. He was very weak. \"Is it wrong to say that there is something positive in all this?\" he said. \"I've had the time to reflect on my life and make sense of it. Time to say to people the things I want them to know. Not everybody is lucky enough to get that\u2026\n\nAnd the next word he used pierced me - and I still feel the sting of it: \"Not everybody is lucky enough to get that luxury.\" And he added in a moment of self-doubt: \"Is it bad, is it taboo, to say that about cancer?\"\n\nI was guided by him, taught by him, at a key time in my own life. I think I will be guided by him all my days. Becoming his friend, being exposed to his abundant affection, has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.\n\nUbuntu: I watched George close up while working in Africa. I marvelled at the way he engaged with people, and the way they reciprocated with their trust.\n\nFor in George's reporting there was an outstretched hand - the outstretched hand of a shared humanity, of solidarity.Some of the messages mocked Katie Price's son Harvey\n\nEight serving and former Metropolitan Police officers have been found guilty of gross misconduct over offensive messages shared in a WhatsApp group.\n\nThe \"discriminatory and offensive\" messages included some that made fun of Katie Price's disabled son.\n\nThe seven men and one woman were found by a panel to have sent sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic messages.\n\nDaniel Hobbs, representing the force, called for all eight to be dismissed and placed on the police barred list.\n\nSpeaking at the hearing after the guilty rulings, Mr Hobbs said this should happen \"as a priority\". This would mean they would never be able to work for the police again.\n\nTwo of the eight officers are still serving in the force, while the other six have resigned or already been dismissed.\n\nThe panel is set to hand down its sanctions for each officer on Friday.\n\nThe hearing concerned former Sgt Luke Thomas, former acting Sgt Luke Allen, former PC Kelsey Buchan, former PC Carlo Francisco, former PC Lee South, former PC Darren Jenner, PC Glynn Rees, and \"Officer B\", who has been granted anonymity.\n\nThe panel found the eight officers had also failed to challenge other group members' conduct.\n\nSome of their messages, sent between May 2016 and June 2018, \"applauded sexual violence against women\", the fifth day of the hearing in central London was told.\n\nThe panel heard that \"Officer B\" posted an edited photograph of Harvey Price in a chat, accompanied by a caption that had a \"racist tone\" and made fun of his disability.\n\nMr Price, 20, has Prader-Willi syndrome, autism and is partially-sighted.\n\nLegal chairman of the panel Christopher McKay described the post as \"inappropriate and offensive\" to Mr Price, and said it had constituted \"gross misconduct\".\n\nHe described gross misconduct as a \"breach of the standards of professional behaviour that is so serious as to justify dismissal\".\n\nTV presenter and model Ms Price previously described the messages as \"disgusting\". In February, she posted a letter from the Met Police to her Instagram account, which informed her of the upcoming misconduct hearing.\n\nKatie Price said the officers facing allegations of misconduct needed to be \"named, shamed and exposed\"\n\nEx-Sgt Thomas, the most senior-ranking officer in the group, \"appears to have been one of the most active participants\" in the WhatsApp group, the panel found.\n\nMr Thomas mocked Mr Price's weight in some messages and called a junior female officer \"ugly\".\n\nHe also joked he should name his dog \"Auschwitz\" or \"Adolf\", or \"Fred\" or \"Ian\" after \"my two favourite child sex killers\", the hearing was told.\n\nMr McKay said Mr Thomas's failings were \"extremely serious\".\n\n\"He could and should have closed the WhatsApp group as soon as the highly inappropriate nature of the messages became apparent.\n\n\"Instead he became one of its main contributors,\" Mr McKay said.\n\nThe disabilities charity Mencap, for whom Mr Price is an ambassador, described the officers' actions as \"absolutely appalling\".\n\nA charity spokesperson said the outcome of the hearing should \"serve as a warning to those who turn a blind eye or, worse, partake in bullying\".\n\nThe hearing follows a string of high-profile scandals at the Metropolitan Police.\n\nA year-long review into the force concluded last month that racism, misogyny, and homophobia were rife within the ranks.\n\nBaroness Louise Casey was appointed to review the force's culture and standards after the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by serving police officer Wayne Couzens, in 2021.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The government also offered a \u00a31,000 one-off cash payment which was lost when talks failed.\n\nUnions want the offer to be higher to match inflation, and for any pay rise to be funded by extra money from the government rather than from schools' existing budgets.\n\nThe government has offered a 4.3% pay rise for most teachers for 2023-24 with starting salaries reaching \u00a330,000.\n\nThe Department for Education described it as a \"fair and reasonable offer\" and said that schools would receive an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years.\n\nIt said on average across England, the offer is fully funded. This refers to the national picture and each school will be affected differently.\n\nHowever, talks stalled after all four unions rejected the government's offer, saying most schools would have to make cuts elsewhere to afford it.\n\nThey are calling on the government to publish the recommendations of the independent pay review body, which advises what pay rise teachers should be offered for next year.\n\nOldfield Primary School in Chester has partially closed on previous strike days, and will do the same for the July strikes.\n\nHead teacher Alan Brown says the last thing teachers want to do is strike as their students have already missed education because of the pandemic.\n\nBut he says the dispute is about \"the future of these children\" and \"not just about teachers' pay\".\n\n\"This is about funding for schools,\" he says.\n\n\"We have seen a decrease in the amount of funding available for us. We do get more money in our budget, don't get me wrong, but to run a school, it costs a lot more money and something needs to happen to actually get us back in sync.\"\n\nIn Leeds, business owner Virginia Nnomo has three children who all had to stay at home on previous strike days. She is weighing up the cost of childcare and whether it is worth opening her salon for the upcoming strikes.\n\nVirginia Nnomo from Chandos Beauty has had to cancel appointments on previous strike days\n\n\"The cost of a babysitter is a lot of money and she charges me per child, so when I weigh it up, maybe it is better to stay home - but I will lose money, that's for sure,\" Virginia says.\n\nKate, a doctor at the local hospital, had to take time off work when her seven-year-old daughter's primary school closed on previous strike days. But she says she is fully supportive of the teachers.\n\n\"They don't get paid enough money in my opinion so I am quite happy to jiggle things around so we can support them,\" she says, adding that she hopes the dispute is resolved soon.\n\nThree other teaching unions, the NAHT, the NASUWT, and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), are also balloting members on strike action for the autumn term.\n\nThe four unions say they would co-ordinate that action to maximise disruption - which the government has said is \"unreasonable\".\n\nElsewhere in the UK, teachers in Northern Ireland, and NAHT members in Wales, are continuing to take action short of a strike. In Scotland, the pay dispute has ended following a revised pay offer from the Scottish government.\n\nA Department for Education spokesman said the strike would cause disruption for parents across the country.\n\n\"Thousands of schools are receiving significant additional funding as part of the extra \u00a32bn of investment we are providing for both 2023/24 and 2024/25, which will take school funding to its highest level in history next year, as measured by the IFS (Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank).\"\n\nAs is normal process the School Teachers' Review Body has submitted its recommendations to the government on pay for 2023/24, said the spokesman, adding it would consider the recommendations and publish \"in the usual way\".Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nLeicester City and Everton had to settle for a draw in a chaotic match which leaves both in deep trouble at the wrong end of the Premier League table.\n\nThe two clubs started the game in the bottom three but a point was enough to drag Leicester out of the drop zone on goal difference, while Everton stay 19th, one point behind 17th-placed Leeds.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin opened the scoring with just his second goal of the season from the penalty spot, picking himself up to convert after being bundled over by Timothy Castagne.\n\nThe lead lasted just seven minutes as the hosts equalised through Caglar Soyuncu, who rolled home a cool finish from Wout Faes' knockdown.\n\nAnd Leicester turned the game around after 33 minutes as the sprightly Jamie Vardy latched on to James Maddison's through ball before rounding Jordan Pickford and stroking home.\n\nThe Toffees should have levelled before half-time but Calvert-Lewin contrived to miss an open goal from a couple of yards with the ball appearing to strike his heel, before Leicester broke down the other end and Vardy struck the crossbar.\n\u2022 None Three from five? Who faces Premier League relegation?\n\nThere was still time in a breathless first half for Pickford to save Maddison's penalty, which was struck straight down the middle by the England midfielder.\n\nIt proved costly as the visitors drew level nine minutes after the restart when Alex Iwobi guided in a low finish, but neither side were able to find a winner.\n\nEverton, meanwhile, will also be concerned by a serious-looking injury to captain Seamus Coleman, sustained in the opening period following a collision with Boubakary Soumare.\n\nThe game ebbed and flowed between two sides aiming for top-flight survival but was a missed opportunity in their aim to escape the relegation mire.\n\nAn electric atmosphere was generated at King Power Stadium by both the home fans with their 'clappers' and the away supporters through their vociferous backing.\n\nUltimately, Maddison's penalty miss at the end of the first half turned out to be the crucial moment - the playmaker was made to wait to take the spot-kick before fluffing his effort straight at Pickford.\n\nIt would have put Leicester 3-1 up and possibly out of sight, but Sean Dyche's men clawed out a draw courtesy of Iwobi's well-taken strike on 54 minutes.\n\nMidfielder Maddison was heavily involved throughout the game as well as the miss from 12 yards, and saw a low drive and curling effort kept out by his England team-mate.\n\nThe home side recovered from Calvert-Lewin's 15th-minute penalty to turn the game around as defender Soyuncu levelled and Vardy rolled back the years with a vintage finish.\n\nBut Leicester's issues lie in defence where a porous backline have now failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 19 games, dating back to November.\n\nThey also missed the opportunity to collect back-to-back victories at home for the first time in a year and bear all the hallmarks of a relegation-threatened team.\n\nDespite being on a three-game unbeaten run, the Foxes have won just one of their past 12, picking up only six points in the process.\n\nLeicester have four games remaining to preserve their top-flight status, away at Fulham and Newcastle and home games against Liverpool and West Ham on the last day of the season.\n\nWhere will Everton's next point come?\n\nLike their opponents, Everton are stuck in a rut. Despite a bright start the Toffees have now won just one of their past 11 games under Dyche, and the eight points gained on that run have not been enough to drag them out of trouble.\n\nThis was a significant chance to get back to winning ways and it started well through Calvert-Lewin's thumping penalty, but it is difficult to see where the points might come in their remaining games.\n\nThey travel to impressive Brighton in", "criticism, PLT says the brand didn't intend \"to cause offence\".\n\n\"As a brand we endeavour to build a community of everybody in PLT, a movement towards equality, body positivity regardless of body type, race or gender and collectively we celebrate multiple holidays throughout the calendar year,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nFor more on this listen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network from 15:00-18:00 BST on Wednesday 19 April, or catch it afterwards on BBC Sounds.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has issued a \"sincere, heartfelt and unreserved\" apology to people affected by the practice of forced adoption.\n\nThousands of unmarried women in Scotland were forced to give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.\n\nThe first minister told Holyrood it was time to \"acknowledge the terrible wrongs that have been done\".\n\nShe said: \"What happened to these women is almost impossible to comprehend.\"\n\nIt is estimated 60,000 women in Scotland had babies adopted simply because they were unmarried.\n\nMany women were coerced into handing over their babies and some were denied access to housing and social benefits which may have allowed them to have kept them.\n\nSome children forcibly removed from their parents as a result of forced adoption were abused, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs.\n\nShe added: \"It is important to say very clearly that many of them went to loving homes - acknowledging these injustices should never be seen as a rejection of the deep bonds that people share with adopted families.\n\n\"Nothing can ever invalidate the love that these families have for one another. But it is also clear that many of those affected - far too many - had a very, very different experience.\n\n\"We know some will always have lacked a sense of belonging, some may have suffered mistreatment or abuse.\"\n\nAddressing MSPs in the Holyrood chamber as victims and campaigners watched on from the public gallery, Ms Sturgeon said forced adoption was \"a level of injustice which is hard now for us to comprehend\".\n\nShe said it was caused by a society that treated women as \"second class citizens\".\n\nMarion McMillan, seated in the centre, was in Holyrood to hear the apology along with fellow campaigners and MSPs\n\nMarion McMillan, from Paisley, was 17-years-old when she had her son taken from her after she gave birth in a Christian mother and baby home.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, she said: \"I was just a wee lassie and I left this country called Scotland, to go to this country England I only knew in the geography books.\n\n\"We were absolutely thrown to the wolves - you couldn't even go to the church. You were stuck in the darkest of providences.\n\n\"Not only did your family reject you, the whole of society rejected you. You couldn't tell anyone you had this baby.\"\n\nMs McMillan, now in her seventies, said the formal apology will bring a \"great measure of healing\" to thousands of mothers and adoptees.\n\nThe first minister made the apology in the Scottish Parliament\n\nFiona Aitken, director of the Adoption UK Scotland charity, said: \"We wholeheartedly support the apology for those who had their children removed and are particularly pleased to see this extend to the individuals who were adopted through this practice, whose lifelong needs have gone unacknowledged and unsupported.\n\n\"Adoption UK now calls on other UK governments to follow Scotland's lead in issuing a formal apology to all those who have been affected by forced adoptions, and to meet the needs of all adopted individuals who would benefit from support.\"\n\nThe apology in Scotland follows others around the world.\n\nIn 2013, Australia issued the world's first government formal apology for forced adoption, taking responsibility for the practice.\n\nThen in 2021 the Irish government apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades.\n\nThe Scottish government has committed funding of about \u00a3145,000 to provide specialist support and counselling for those affected by forced adoption and research is also under way to identify how existing support services can be improved.\n\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher, said: \"Although a national apology cannot right the wrongs of the past, I hope that it will be the start of a healing process for those suffering lifelong trauma.\n\n\"My only regret is that some campaigners have sadly died before this apology was made.\"\n\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie, said: \"These appalling cruelties are perhaps among the most heinous of injustices that our society has inflicted on women and their children.\"The Scottish government has called for the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use.\n\nIt wants the UK government to change the laws to allow people to be \"treated and supported rather than criminalised and excluded\".\n\nHowever, it would still be an offence to have possession of drugs with the intention of supplying them to others.\n\nThe government also wants the law to be changed to allow the introduction of supervised drug consumption facilities.\n\nDrugs laws are currently reserved to Westminster.\n\nHowever, the Scottish government has responsibility for health and social policies around drug consumption.\n\nOther proposals from the Scottish government include more substance checking services and increased access to emergency treatments for drug overdoses.\n\nAnnouncing the proposals, Scotland's Drugs Policy Minister Elena Whitham said the \"war on drugs has failed\".\n\nShe added: \"That's a fact. I don't think we can dispute that.\n\n\"Our current drug law does not stop people from using drugs, it does not stop people from experiencing the harm associated and, critically, it does not stop people from dying.\n\n\"In fact, I would say today here, that criminalisation increases the harms people experience. Criminalisation kills.\"\n\nThe call comes four years after the SNP backed decriminalising the possession and consumption of drugs at its party conference.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Illegal drugs destroy lives and devastate communities. We are committed to preventing drug use by supporting people through treatment and recovery and tackling the supply of illegal drugs, as set out in our 10-year drugs strategy. \"We have no plans to decriminalise drugs given the associated harms, including the risks posed by organised criminals, who will use any opportunity to operate an exploitative and violent business model.\"\n\nThe number of people who died of drug misuse in Scotland dropped slightly last year from 1,339 to 1,330 after eight consecutive years of increases, but the country continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe.\n\nThe crisis prompted more than \u00a3250m of investment by the Scottish government into the country's addiction services.\n\nEfforts to establish drug consumption rooms in Scotland have been ongoing for years.\n\nCampaigners say the facilities - where people can inject drugs under supervision - are needed and are backed by the Scottish government.\n\nHowever, an attempt to set up consumption rooms in Glasgow was blocked by UK government, which argued a range of crimes would be committed in the course of running such facilities.\n\nIn 2021, a decision by the Lord Advocate meant people caught with Class A drugs in Scotland could be given a police warning instead of facing prosecution.\n\nCritics at the time said the move, which does not extend to drug dealing, was \"de facto decriminalisation\".\n\nScottish Conservative justice spokesman Russell Findlay added: \"It is madness to try and solve Scotland's drug death crisis, the worst in Europe, by essentially legalising heroin, crack and other class-A drugs.\n\n\"This would put more drugs on our streets. It would put more lives at risk. \"\n\nThe shift was also ruled out by UK Labour with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves telling journalists during a visit to Scotland: \"I don't think this sounds like a good policy.\"\n\nA joint statement from 10 leading drugs charities welcomed the Scottish government's report, but said drug consumption rooms and drug testing facilities \"as a matter of urgency\".\n\nIt's the first week of the Scottish Parliament recess.

They separated in 2020 after he came out as gay.\n\nSchofield said he was \"so, very, very sorry\" for being unfaithful to his wife, and for lying to his colleagues, agents, employers, friends, the media, the public and his family about the relationship.\n\nHe continued: \"Contrary to speculation, whilst I met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television, it was only after he started to work on the show that it became more than just a friendship.\"\n\nHe also said he would \"reflect on my very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it\".\n\nIt followed rumours circulating on social media over several months about Schofield's personal relationships.\n\nSchofield was married to Stephanie Lowe at the time of the affair\n\nThe 61-year-old's exit from ITV means he will no longer present the British Soap Awards next month.\n\nHe will also not front a new prime-time series which the network originally said last week they were developing with him.\n\nDermot O'Leary, who has been covering for Schofield on This Morning since his exit, declined to discuss the matter on Saturday.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment, especially without any knowledge,\" he told reporters outside BBC Radio 2, where he presents a weekend show.\n\nSchofield left his role at This Morning last week following reports of a rift with co-star Willoughby.\n\nHe had presented the ITV show since 2002, with Willoughby joining him as a co-presenter in 2009.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Schofield said his departure from This Morning was unrelated to the affair with the colleague, who the BBC is not naming.\n\nHis final appearance on the programme was on Thursday 18 May, before he announced his departure from the show that weekend.\n\nWilloughby said it had \"taken time to process\" the news that Schofield lied about his affair\n\nCover presenters Hammond and O'Leary paid tribute to Schofield at the start of Monday's programme.\n\nWilloughby is currently taking time off from the show but is set to return to presenting duties on Monday 5 June.\n\nTalent agency YMU has also cut ties with Schofield following his announcement about the affair.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Schofield said: \"It is with the most profound regret that after 35 years of being faultlessly managed by YMU I have agreed to step down from their representation with immediate effect.\"\n\nIn May, his brother Timothy Schofield was jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of sexually abusing a boy.Xu Yao, who worked on the Netflix adaptation, poisoned his colleague Lin Qi over a business dispute\n\nThe release of Netflix's series 3 Body Problem has been watched millions of times around the globe since its release late last month.\n\nIt has even found an audience in China where Netflix is unavailable, sparking much chatter among viewers of the series.\n\nBut many fans of the three-book series, credited with propelling China's nascent science fiction genre after its publication in 2008, have also been paying attention to a court room in Shanghai where one of the key players behind the adaptation was sentenced to death just a day after the show's release.\n\nHis crime? Murdering a man sometimes dubbed China's \"billionaire millennial\" - the gaming tycoon Lin Qi, whose company Yoozoo Games owns the rights for film adaptations of the Chinese science fiction epic.\n\nAccording to the court, Xu Yao, who was known as a distinguished lawyer, became consumed by professional rivalry after Lin sidelined him shortly after he helped land the Netflix deal in 2020.\n\nWithin months of this apparent slight, Lin was dead - the victim of a poisoning plot described as both \"premeditated\" and \"extremely despicable\" by the court last week.\n\nFor fans of The Three-Body Problem, which features an alien civilisation and is set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, the parallels were clear.\n\n\"At least we know that Xu Yao and Lin Qi have read The Three-Body Problem thoroughly. Lose your humanity and you lose a lot; lose your animal nature and you lose everything,\" said one comment on China's Weibo.\n\nLin and Xu were reportedly on good terms at the start: Lin had appointed Xu to spearhead a subsidiary called The Three Body Universe a year after he joined Yoozoo as the company's chief risk officer in 2017.\n\nThe subsidiary was in charge of securing intellectual property rights for the film adaptations, and the two had worked closely together in brokering the deal to adapt the novel into a Netflix original series.\n\nBut they fell out when Lin - who founded Yoozoo in 2009 - decided to put other executives in charge of business operations, local reports said. Xu, authorities al", "NHS health care assistant from north Wales.\n\n\"She'd also been abused, possibly even sexually.\n\n\"As a result it took me two years to gain her trust, she was totally shut down and fearful around people.\n\n\"But eventually she became so loving and clingy - she'd follow me everywhere and would even come on walks with me around my village.\"\n\nHowever, in early 2018, Rosa was diagnosed with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Linda was told her constant companion would have to be euthanised.\n\n\"It put the fear of God into me, but after reading about FIV I learned it needn't be a death sentence and that cats who have it can lead fairly normal lives if cared for properly,\" she said.\n\nRosa was rescued from a life of abuse and spent years learning to trust Linda\n\nRosa managed to live for several more months, until she had an operation on her mouth that required her taking steroids.\n\n\"But you can't give steroids to a cat with FIV, so I had to make the awful decision to let Rosa go.\"\n\nLinda said she later found out, having obtaining her pet's clinical notes, that there was a chance Rosa may never have had FIV in the first place.\n\n\"Rosa should have undergone two tests before she was diagnosed - a simple in-house blood test and another where the blood samples are sent off to an external laboratory for screening.\n\n\"That second test, which would have confirmed her condition, was never ordered though.\n\n\"It made me feel like I'd failed to protect Rosa, that I'd betrayed her - effectively I might as well have killed her myself.\"\n\nConsumed with grief, Linda said she tried to take her own life.\n\n\"One day in early 2019 I walked to a spot near my home that I regularly used to visit with Rosa and I tried to end things,\" said Linda.\n\n\"I wanted a positive to come out of what me and Rosa went through,\" says Linda, pictured with her mobile veterinary vehicle\n\n\"What I didn't know was that my other cat called Gracie had followed me there and her meowing snapped me out of it.\"\n\nInstead, Linda decided to dedicate herself to making sure other pet owners would not have to go through the same ordeal.\n\nHaving subsequently moved to Anglesey, she came up with the idea to set up her own independent mobile vet practice.\n\n\"I wanted a positive to come out of what me and Rosa went through,\" said Linda, who previously led a successful push to ban the use of wild animals at circuses in Wales.\n\nHer mobile vet service is set to launch at the end of this month.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that this is not an individual vet bashing exercise,\" she said.\n\n\"What I'm opposing is the industry increasingly becoming a cost-driven conveyor belt wherein animals are treated as commodities, little more than revenue generators.\n\n\"I don't want the loss of Rosa to have been in vain,\" says Linda\n\n\"And so are the staff themselves - they're being overworked and put under pressure - that's why I believe Rosa's case was mishandled.\n\n\"Rosa was failed by the system and so were those who treated her.\n\n\"That's why I never took out legal action over what happened because I would have had to name the vets involved and I didn't feel that was fair.\"\n\nLinda said her new venture would have a different approach to both pets and their owners.\n\n\"The mobile unit will have one vet and one veterinary nurse and will be able to treat sick animals in their own homes, thereby alleviating the stress of a visit to the surgery.\n\n\"We're also working with a small animal practice in Conwy who will do any diagnosis and blood work for us.\"\n\nShe said compassion was key in what she hoped to achieve.\n\n\"It's about treating pets as family members, not pound signs.\n\n\"This is my gift to the community and, with the cost of living crisis seeing more and more sick animals being dumped at an alarming rate, it's needed now more than ever.\n\n\"I don't want the loss of Rosa to have been in vain, I want to turn it into something good.\"\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Boris and Carrie Johnson have announced the birth of a son, their third child together and first since he stood down as prime minister.\n\nFrank Alfred Odysseus Johnson was born on 5 July, according to a social media post by Mrs Johnson.\n\nThe new baby joins son Wilfred and daughter Romy, both born during Mr Johnson term in office.\n\nOn Instagram, Mrs Johnson said the family was \"all very smitten\".\n\nThis Instagram post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Lee Anderson explains why he has sympathy with people protesting outside asylum hotels.\n\nConservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson has said he has sympathy with people protesting outside hotels providing refuge for asylum seekers.\n\nA spate of protests have been organised at hotels across the country in recent weeks, with some ending in violent clashes with police.\n\nMany have been led by far-right anti-immigrant groups such as Patriotic Alternative.\n\nMr Anderson said protesters were \"just normal family people\" with concerns about the safety of their community.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Mr Anderson said: \"When you live in a community, you expect to be safe and you don't like sudden change.\n\n\"That is how humans behave.\"\n\nThe Hope Not Hate campaign group accused Mr Anderson of \"parroting the misinformation used by the far-right to exploit hotels\".\n\n\"This is precisely the same kind of myths that the far-right are peddling to whip up hate around hotels,\" a spokesperson said. \"We can't have a Conservative MP amplifying these messages.\"\n\nOne man was charged and 14 other people were arrested after a police officer and two members of the public were hurt when missiles including lit fireworks were thrown at a protest outside a hotel accommodating asylum seekers in Kirkby on 10 February.\n\nThe initial protest had been triggered by an allegation that a man had made inappropriate advances to a local teenage girl.\n\nPatriotic Alternative, whose policies include deporting non-whites, were present at protests at hotels in Skegness and Newquay.\n\nSeveral hotels in Skegness have since been boarded up ahead of a planned further protest against their use to house asylum seekers.\n\nThe latest Home Office figures show 37,000 asylum seekers and Afghan refugees are living in UK hotels at a cost of \u00a34.7m per day.\n\nA police van was burnt out in the clash in Kirkby\n", "to be done\n\nOpposition parties say newly-released documents raise further concerns about the procurement of two overdue ferries being built at Ferguson shipyard.\n\nEmails from 2014 show that ministers and civil servants checked that the Port Glasgow yard would be ready to bid before the process began.\n\nSeparately, owner Jim McColl says he was offered advice to ensure his firm was \"well positioned\".\n\nThe Scottish government said it was trying to \"maximise competition\".\n\nBut Scottish Labour's Neil Bibby said the emails raised \"serious concerns about the procurement process\".\n\nHe said there was a need to \"get to the bottom\" of what happened during the procurement process, and why.\n\n\"Despite claims from the government that they have released all relevant correspondence, more and more information comes to light,\" he said.\n\nScottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said the documents showed just how closely ministers and officials were involved in discussions between government-owned ferries agency CMAL and Mr McColl's company.\n\n\"That seems unusual during a procurement process - particularly when there is still no transparency over this deal, which ended up costing the Scottish taxpayer hundreds of millions and has failed to deliver for islanders,\" he said.\n\nThe order for a small ferry, later named MV Catriona, was awarded to the Ferguson shipyard shortly after Jim McColl took over\n\nThe new documents have been released under freedom of information rules. They relate to the earliest weeks of the procurement of Glen Sannox and Hull 802, which are massively overbudget and still being built at the Ferguson Marine shipyard in Port Glasgow.\n\nIn the autumn of 2014, Mr McColl had just taken over the yard and was starting to re-hire some of the 70-strong workforce made redundant when Ferguson's went into administration in mid-August.\n\nIn late September his new company Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL) was directly awarded the \u00a312.3m contract for a small diesel/electric hybrid ferry for CalMac, two of which the yard had built successfully under its previous owners.\n\nBut Mr McColl had ambitious modernisation plans, and was interested in bidding for the contract for the two much larger CalMac ships, even though they would be bigger and more complex than anything previously built at the small Inverclyde shipyard.\n\nThe new documents include an email dated 1 October from a Transport Scotland official, whose name is redacted, asking then Transport Minister Keith Brown to approve the start of the formal procurement process for the 100m-long ferries.\n\nThe email, cc'd to Finance Secretary John Swinney, continues: \"Tom Docherty [chief executive of CMAL] discussed this with Jim McColl yesterday to ensure that Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL) would be in a position to meet the PQQ [pre-qualification questionnaire] requirements within CMAL's proposed timescale.\n\n\"Mr McColl confirmed that he was content whilst noting that FMEL now had to gear up following the award of the third hybrid contract.\"\n\nJim McColl, seated left, and Tom Docherty from CMAL, seated right, signed the contract for the ferries in October 2015\n\nThe email to Keith Brown also notes that a \"spin off\" benefit of beginning the procurement for the two larger ferries was that it might deter \"disgruntled\" shipyards from challenging the direct award of the smaller ferry contract to Ferguson's.\n\nThe BBC contacted Mr McColl who confirmed that he met Tom Docherty at the shipyard on 30 September to tell the workers about the awarding of the small ferry contract.\n\nA note in his diary, from one of his assistants, says: \"Tom keen to discuss with you the tender timeframe that's required for the next two ferries. He will issue a PQQ in a week requesting responses by November.\n\n\"He suggests we might want to get someone in to help with the PQQ process to ensure Fergusons was well positioned as he expects us to have a number of gaps given current manpower and facilities.\"\n\nA leading procurement law expert told the BBC that it could be possible for CMAL to contact Fergusons as a potential supplier at that stage of the process - but that the yard should not be given an unfair advantage.\n\nProf Luke Butler, of the University of Nottingham, added: \"It would be good practice to enter discussions with a range of potential suppliers and ensure that these are properly documented.\"\n\nKeith Brown was transport minister in Alex Salmond's government when the procurement began\n\nThe formal launch of the procurement process by Keith Brown took place a fortnight later at an event in Ardrossan.\n\nThe newly-released documents include a Q&A briefing paper prepared for the minister which suggested how he might answer the question: \"Is it well within the capability and capacity of Fergusons Shipbuilders of Port Glasgow to build it?\"\n\nThe answer was: \"Yes. The aim of the new owners Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL) is to build the company up so that it is employing many hundreds of workers.\n\n\"Trying to secure further shipbuilding contracts will be an important part of generating those jobs.\"\n\nThe briefing also provided Mr Brown with a quote from Jim McColl: \"I would expect to be able to get some work in there that would allow us - probably in the first year to 18 months - to get the employee numbers up to about 100 or 120 people.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has repeatedly denied suggestions that it interfered in the award of the contracts, which would have been a breach of EU procurement laws.\n\nLast year a BBC Disclosure documentary - The Great Ferries Scandal - presented evidence that the procurement for the two ferries may have been rigged in favour of FMEL.\n\nMr McColl has previously told the BBC that if this was the case, it happened without his knowledge.\n\nCMAL declined to comment on the latest documents, but noted that it had appointed a KC to investigate the allegations made in the BBC documentary. It said this investigation was ongoing.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Ministers and CMAL have always been clear that they wanted to maximise competition for these contracts, including from FMEL as a local shipyard that had very recently been saved from closure by the action of the Scottish government and Mr McColl's investment company.\n\n\"FMEL still had to take part in an open and transparent procurement process against a number of rival bidders in order to win the contracts to build hulls 801 and 802.\"Applications to join nursing programmes in Scotland have slumped in the past year, according to new figures.\n\nUCAS data has shown a drop of 19% in applications in the 12 months up to 30 June.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has called the figure \"significant\" and a \"cause for concern\".\n\nThe Scottish government said it valued student nurses and midwives and that they received the highest student bursary in Scotland.\n\nLatest figures reveal 6,450 applicants sought a place on Scottish courses, compared to 7,930 in 2022 and 9,010 in 2021.\n\nAnd the number signing up to study nursing at this point in the UCAS cycle is below the pre-pandemic number of 7,290 applicants from 2019.\n\nThe number of applicants was highest in 2021, reflecting an increase in demand for certain courses, including medicine and nursing, during the global health crisis.\n\nThe trend marks a further blow to NHS recovery as it already deals with high vacancy rates.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing said 8.5% of registered nurse posts remained vacant at the end of March.\n\nIn June it emerged that annual spending on NHS temporary staff in Scotland rose to a record high of more than \u00a3560m - an increase of over a third compared with the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, data showed that in the year up to 31 March, \u00a3447.4m was spent on bank and agency nursing and midwifery staff.\n\nThe biggest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, spent almost \u00a3130m to cover nursing and midwife shortages.\n\nRCN Scotland's director, Colin Poolman, said: \"This significant drop in applications to nursing courses in Scotland is a real cause for concern amid", "edly owned by Cde Bona and her estranged hubby\".\n\nBona Mugabe pictured with her father, former President Mugabe, during his 91st birth celebrations, and mother, Grace\n\nIt is unclear when the divorce case - being heard by a court in the capital, Harare - will end.\n\nMs Mugabe and Ms Chikore were married at a lavish wedding in 2014 that was attended by several African heads of state - and was broadcast live on state television.\n\nMr Mugabe died in 2019 at the age of 95, reportedly without leaving a will.

Party leader Humza Yousaf said there would be \"external input\" into the review\n\nThe SNP's ruling body has ordered a review of transparency and the way the party is managed after recent controversy over its finances.\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) met on Saturday amid a police probe and a row over the release of membership numbers.\n\nParty leader Humza Yousaf said a new working group would publish an interim report in June.\n\nIt will be followed by a full report ahead of the SNP's autumn conference.\n\nAsked if the review would go far enough, Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland: \"It is important that the financial oversight that we are committed to improving comes from the external input as opposed to within the party.\"\n\nLast week Mr Yousaf revealed that he had been unware until he became leader that the SNP's auditors had resigned more than six months ago.\n\nThe firm Johnston Carmichael quit last September, and there is concern the party may be unable to conduct an audit due in July.\n\nOn Thursday, the new SNP leader and first minister also said he only recently learned that the SNP had bought a luxury motorhome.\n\nIt was seized by police from outside a property in Dunfermline as part of an investigation into the party's finances.\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell was questioned by police but released without charge\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon's husband, was also arrested on 5 April while their home was searched. He was later released without charge.\n\nMr Murrell resigned from his SNP position last month after misleading statements about party membership numbers were given to a journalist.\n\nOn Saturday the NEC approved proposals for the appointment of a new chief executive through an \"open and transparent\" external recruitment process.\n\nPrior to the NEC meeting, one committee member had suggested he might resign unless \"forensic auditors\" were appointed to examine the party's finances. A forensic audit is used to uncover evidence that could be used in a court of law.\n\nBill Ramsay, the SNP trade union group convener, said: \"I have been raising issues about the governance of the party for some time.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the call to appoint forensic auditors is not moved forward, I will have to seriously consider whether I can continue on the NEC.\"\n\nPolice carried out a search of the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh last week as part of their investigation.\n\nOn Saturday Mr Yousaf dismissed speculation that the SNP could be facing bankruptcy. He replied: \"It's not. The party is solvent.\"\n\nThe police investigation follows complaints about how the party spent more than \u00a3600,000 of donations that it received from activists to fund a future independence referendum campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Yousaf was in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency on Saturday, where there is the prospect of a by-election.\n\nMargaret Ferrier won the seat for the SNP in 2019 - but was later found to have damaged the reputation of the Commons and placed people at risk by taking part in a debate and travelling by train after testing positive for Covid-19. She now sits as an independent.\n\nIf she is barred from the Commons for 10 days or more, that could trigger a recall petition, which would result in a by-election in the constituency - although 10% of voters there would need to support this for it to go ahead.\n\nMr Yousaf told the BBC the party took \"de", "\n\n\"We met with NHS England four times per day during the last strikes to monitor the situation, but there were no requests for a temporary stoppage of the industrial action to be made. The same proven arrangements will be in place this time.\"\n\nAnd she added: \"No-one understands better than us - the doctors who care for them - that patients are getting a sub-standard experience 365 days a year from an overstretched and understaffed NHS.\n\n\"In this brutal work environment, patient care is at risk every day.\"\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike?

The video shows two vehicles speeding ahead of the motorist, losing control and crashing into several more cars which then also spin out of control on the motorway.\n\nDallas police would not confirm to the BBC whether the American football player was among those involved in the crash, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nOn Monday, Kansas City Chiefs president Mark Donovan said during a radio interview with local station KCMO: \"In all these situations you have to wait until you have all the facts and frankly, we don't have all the facts at this point.\n\n\"We'll get to the bottom of it, we'll gather the facts and we'll react accordingly,\" he added.\n\nTwo drivers were treated at the scene for minor injuries and two motorists in another vehicle were taken to a local hospital.\n\n\"No one stopped,\" Kayla Quinn, who said her car was damaged in the crash, told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nMarc Lenahan, a personal injury attorney who represents a victim of the crash, told the BBC his firm's research links the Corvette to Rashee Rice and the Lamborghini to a local luxury car rental service.\n\nMr Rice, who is from the Dallas area, was drafted to the NFL last year and played in the Chiefs' second consecutive Super Bowl victory in February.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: a speeded up video of lightning across the Sahel, Europe and Central Africa\n\nSpectacular movies of lightning spreading across the Earth have just been released by the European weather agency Eumetsat.\n\nThey were made by a new instrument that was placed 36,000km above equatorial Africa in December.\n\nThe imager, once fully commissioned, will become a key tool for forecasters as they track the emergence of violent storms.\n\nLightning often precedes heavy rain, hail and even big gusts of wind.\n\nPhil Evans, the director-general of Eumetsat, described the movies as \"fantastic\".\n\n\"The Americans have had an instrument like this over their part of the world for a few years now, but this is the first one for Europe and Africa,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"Our imager is more sophisticated in terms of resolution and performance, so there's a lot of excitement about how its imagery can be used.\"\n\nArtwork: Meteosat-12 is part of a multi-billion-euro upgrade to Europe's weather observing system\n\nEumetsat is the intergovernmental organisation charged with managing Europe's meteorological assets in orbit.\n\nIt's currently testing the recently launched Meteosat-12 platform, a next-generation weather-observing spacecraft that scientists expect to initiate a step change in so-called \"nowcasting\" - the forewarning of challenging atmospheric conditions on very short time horizons, in the order of just hours.\n\nMonitoring lightning behaviour will be central to this capability.\n\nMeteosat-12's lightning detector has four telescopic cameras focused on Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of South America.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: On 12 June, the imager tracked a lightning swarm across the UK\n\nTheir detectors continuously look for the light pulses produced by cloud-to-ground, cloud-to-cloud and intra-cloud lightning flashes.\n\nThey can do this day or night, and will catch even a single lightning bolt.\n\n\"The minimum duration of a lightning [detection] is 0.6 milliseconds; that means 1,000 times faster than the blink of an eye,\" said Guia Pastorini from Leonardo, the Italian aerospace company that designed and built the instrument.\n\nThere is an impressive movie of lightning over the UK on 12 June.\n\n\"The location of the thunderstorms was captured really clearly from the satellite, and made even more fascinating by the development of a 'Mesoscale Convective System' or MCS,\" said BBC Weather forecaster Simon King.\n\n\"This is a thunderstorm which under certain circumstances grows larger and spawns more thunderstorms. The satellite picks up this area of cloud initially in south-east England but we then see the flashes of lightning develop on its forward edge as it grows and moves north-west.\"\n\nLightning is often a tracer for extreme weather\n\nIn Europe, forecasters already have very effective ground systems to detect lightning. The ATDNet (Arrival Time Difference Network) senses a discharge from its radio frequency emission. Radar is also used.\n\n\"But those lightning networks tend to detect mainly the cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, rather than the cloud-to-cloud, or intra-cloud lightning,\" explained Simon Keogh, the head of space applications and nowcasting R&D at the UK Met Office.\n\n\"Those cloud-to-ground strikes make up only about 10% of the lightning activity in the atmosphere. So, the other 90% is lightning activity within the cloud, which is what the optical satellite is detecting. I see these systems as being totally complementary.\"\n\nMeteosat-12's view of Earth: Africa in particular should benefit from the new technology\n\nAnd in Africa, where most lightning on Earth occurs, there are fewer radio frequency systems. The Meteosat information will, therefore, be particularly useful to forecasters.\n\nThe same applies to ocean monitoring. The imager is watching what's happening out over the Atlantic, which should improve the safe routing of long haul airliners.\n\nClimate researchers are sure to be interested in the new imager's data. It'll help them develop much better statistics on the frequency of lightning over time.\n\nAtmospheric chemists, too, will be fascinated.

The move - which needs parliamentary approval - is seen as a pointed rebuke to Russia.\n\nMr Zelensky said he had signed a decree that the day would commemorate European unity and the defeat of \"Ruscism\" - a term that is shorthand for \"Russian fascism\".\n\nHe also said that 8 May would now officially be a Day of Remembrance and Victory, as marked in many countries around the world.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will hold talks with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, as Russia is preparing for Tuesday's Victory Day parade on Moscow's Red Square, the Kremlin is yet to reveal what President Vladimir Putin's role will be at the annual event.\n\nLast year, Mr Putin addressed the marching troops and was seen sitting among World War Two veterans in the VIP box.\n\nRussia says the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - all former Soviet republics - are expected at the parade, which has been otherwise snubbed by major world countries, including the UK, the US and France - all wartime allies of the then Soviet Union.\n\nIn a separate development, a court in Berlin banned the carrying of Russian and Soviet flags during rallies at Soviet war memorials in the German capital on 9 May.Stephen Lawrence was killed in April 1993, at Eltham in south-east London\n\nEarlier this week, the BBC publicly named a major suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder. In response, Stephen's mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence said, \"It should not have taken a journalist to do the job that a huge, highly resourced institution should have done.\" Correspondent Daniel De Simone started investigating the case after the Metropolitan Police stopped.\n\nInvestigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence is a journey into the past and the present.\n\nStephen was murdered 30 years ago in a racist attack by a gang of young white men.\n\nTwo years ago, I set out to follow a lead which had the potential to bring significant new information to light.\n\nThe Met had stopped investigating Stephen's murder in 2020. I wanted to do what I could to investigate the outstanding suspects and hold them to account.\n\nI had no previous experience of covering the case and I felt daunted by it. Journalists had been covering the story since the 1990s, and there had been more than 15 police investigations or official inquiries. Who was I to imagine I could find anything new?\n\nThe lead I followed related to a man who was said to have possibly been there when Stephen was murdered. I was unsure whether this was as a witness or a suspect. I did not know the man's identity, and it took months to get a name. In the meantime, I read everything I could about Stephen's case.\n\nWhen I got a name, I realised the man - Matthew White - was the person in the case known as Witness K.\n\nI had read a lot about Witness K. His claimed role did not involve being present during the attack, but instead acting as a central link in a chain of how information was passed around on the night of the murder.\n\nThis chain was said to have included a brief visit by K to the home of suspects Neil and Jamie Acourt.\n\nWhite died in 2021, aged 50, around the time I started investigating, meaning I was unable to approach him.\n\nA constant source of help and advice was Clive Driscoll, the retired Met detective who had brought two of Stephen's killers to justice. He told me that following the two murder convictions he achieved in 2012, he had focused on the other killers.\n\nOne of those he investigated was Matthew White, and Clive told an extraordinary tale of finding that an approach by one of White's stepfathers had been disastrously mishandled by the Met in 1993.\n\nClive had arrested White in late 2013, after personally tracing the right stepfather, who said White had admitted being present during the murder. But Clive had been unable to complete his investigation after Scotland Yard replaced him as senior investigating officer and he was asked to retire.\n\nI felt silly even thinking it, but I was trying to conduct my own murder investigation.\n\nAn artist's impression of the \"fair-haired attacker\", Matthew White photographed a fortnight after the murder, and a police e-fit\n\nThe complexity of Stephen's case has increased with time - and the number of investigations and inquiries have only added to the already large volume of information.\n\nI had to try to get across three decades of evidence, much of it hidden in police files. I gained access to previously secret documents about the case and read every transcript from the 1998 Macpherson public inquiry into the murder. Several people helped me confidentially, providing crucial information during the process of checking and corroboration.\n\nIt became clear there was a gaping hole in the case.\n\nOn the night of the murder, Stephen's friend Duwayne Brooks had said there were six attackers, and gave a description of a fair-haired attacker who did not fit the profile of the five well-known prime suspects. Eyewitnesses to the murder had described the same person. Who was he? Why did everyone seem to have forgotten about this key point?\n\nIn addition, Matthew White had been referred to many times in the case. I found Kent Police had told the Met in 1997 to get to the bottom of his role, and had raised the prospect of him being present during the attack. The issue had been raised during the Macpherson inquiry hearings the following year.\n\nIn 2000, I discovered a witness had told the Met about White confessing to being present during the attack and playing a leading role in it. This witness had spoken to police independently of White's stepfather, who Clive Driscoll tracked down. Checked against the evidence of Duwayne Brooks and eyewitnesses, the account of White's confession was compelling.\n\nIt was clear that White was a suspect and that police had eventually treated him as one. How fair was this designation? Was he the sixth man?\n\nI sought to crosscheck everything else I was finding on White against other evidence, including witness accounts from 1993. White surely had an alibi for the night, given that he was known as Witness K and appeared so prominently in narratives of the case?\n\nThe failure of the first police investigation", "said it was \"fully committed to helping rebuild Scottish cricket\".\n\nA spokesperson acknowledged that it had been \"an exceptionally challenging time\" and thanked Mr Luthra for his contribution. It said it would take \"immediate steps to provide additional leadership and governance support to Cricket Scotland\".\n\nCricket Scotland thanked Mr Luthra for his \"hard work and input\" and said it would not respond to the \"personal opinions\" which had been expressed.\n\nIt said SportScotland was helping put in place short-term measures such as the appointment of an interim chief executive.\n\n\"The cricket season is less than four weeks away and there is much to be done, and the team remain fully focused on delivery in all areas,\" it said.\n\nNational cricket has been in crisis in Scotland since the independent report on racism, published in July 2022, was highly critical of the governance of the organisation.\n\nFormer player Majid Haq, who was among those to raise concerns, has also been critical over progress\n\nAn anti-racism working group was formed at the end of last year following the publication of the report, which found 448 instances of racism in the sport.\n\nIn a six-month update, Mr Luthra said progress was being made and that he expected special measures imposed by funding body SportScotland would be lifted.\n\nHe said Cricket Scotland would deliver the recommendations \"to a high standard and beyond\".\n\nHowever, Running Out Racism contested his claims that the organisation had significantly improved its approach to equality, diversion and inclusion.\n\nFour members resigned from the working group on 27 March - Scotland women's international Abtaha Maqsood; businessman Imran Khan; academic Khadija Mohammed, and Raza Sadiq, from Running Out Racism.\n\nFormer players Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh, who were among those to raise concerns about racism in the sport, have also been critical of what they see as a lack of progress.\n\nThey welcomed Mr Luthra's resignation and said Cricket Scotland should remain in special measures until it delivered on eradicating racism from the sport.\n\nBBC Scotland understands that Cricket Scotland's anti-racism working group only met once.Junior doctors in Scotland have called off a planned strike after a new pay offer from the Scottish government.\n\nBMA Scotland said it agreed to suspend next week's strike while they consult members on the proposal for a 12.4% pay increase for 2023/24.\n\nAlongside a pay rise of 4.5% for 2022/23, this will give a total pay increase of 17.5% over two years.\n\nThey had been due to strike between 12 and 15 July after previously rejecting a 14.5% pay rise over two years.\n\nThe new deal also includes a commitment to future years pay, contract and pay bargaining modernisation.\n\nThe union has recommended that its members accept the offer.\n\nBMA Scotland met with Health Secretary Michael Matheson on Friday to discuss an improved offer which the union said would now be put to its members, who will decide whether to accept it or not.\n\nEarlier in the week, First Minister Humza Yousaf had promised to attend pay talks in a bid to avoid industrial action.\n\nHe had warned that a strike would be \"very significant indeed\" for the NHS and could would lead to \"tens of thousands of cancellations of appointments\".\n\nThe latest offer could end a months-long dispute over pay and working conditions.\n\nThe union has said previous pay awards for junior doctors in Scotland had delivered real-terms pay cuts of 23.5% since 2008.\n\nIt has called for a 23.5% pay increase for junior doctors - fully-qualified medics who are not specialty staff doctors, consultants or GPs.\n\nThey make up 44% of the doctors in the NHS in Scotland.\n\nBMA Scotland said the pay deal was reviewed by the Scottish Junior Doctors Committee (SJDC) in an emergency meeting on Friday.\n\nCommittee chair Chris Smith said the improved offer involved \"compromise on both sides\" and was a \"genuinely credible and workable pathway towards pay restoration\".\n\nDr Smith said: \"At this stage, our negotiation team feels we have reached the limit of what can be achieved this year and does not think strike action would result in a realistically improved offer.\n\n\"Equally, it could potentially endanger the commitment that the Scottish government has offered to work with us to achieve pay restoration as an alternative to a sustained and escalated industrial dispute.\n\n\"It is our view that acceptance of this offer is the best way of achieving full pay restoration for doctors in Scotland.\"\n\nThe SJDC has recommended that the offer is accepted.\n\nMr Matheson said: \"I hope this investment and the significant commitments we have given around pay and contract reform will show junior doctors how much we value them, and that we are determined to ensure that Scotland is the place for junior doctors to work and train.\n\n\"Some patients may have been contacted to say their treatment has been cancelled.\n\n\"We are working hard with health boards to make sure appointments that can go ahead do, and that any others are rescheduled as soon as possible.\"\n\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

But it's the mismanagement of that injury that can lead to tragic circumstances, as with Ben's case.\n\n\"There's a risk in all sports. But with greater awareness and education, we are moving forward and making it a safer place.\"\n\nFor ", "aalim's account matches details in a UN report published on 13 July, saying local people were forced to dispose of the bodies of at least 87 ethnic Masalit and others allegedly killed by the RSF in a mass grave in West Darfur.\n\nThe metadata on the photos and videos in Maalim's phone show that they were taken between 20 and 21 June, the same dates mentioned in the UN report.\n\nLike the UN report, Maalim told us the bodies were buried in an open area known as al-Turab al-Ahmar (Red Soil), west of El Geneina and near a police base.\n\nThe UN statement said some of the people had died from untreated injuries. In one of Maalim's videos, a man is found alive among a pile of dead bodies. Flies hover around his dry, cracked lips as he tries to speak. Maalim says the victim had been lying there for eight days, suffering from gunshot wounds. We do not know what has happened to this man.\n\nMaalim tells us he took the videos because he wanted to document what was happening in his hometown. But he soon felt it was no longer safe for him to stay in the city.\n\n\"I was afraid because more than once they were searching for people who had mobile phones on them while doing the clean-up.\"\n\nSome corpses were left to rot on the streets\n\nDarfur's Arab and Black African communities have been at loggerheads for years - with the worst violence erupting two decades ago when non-Arabs took up arms accusing the government of discrimination.\n\nThe RSF was born out of the notorious Janjaweed Arab militia, which brutally suppressed the rebellion, killing hundreds of thousands of people. The group was accused of widespread atrocities and ethnic killings, described as the first genocide of the 21st Century.\n\nFighting between the RSF and the Sudanese army, which erupted in April, seems to have re-ignited this conflict. Last month, the West Darfur governor was killed shortly after he accused the RSF of carrying out a genocide against the Masalit people.\n\nThis round of violence in many parts of Darfur doesn't appear to be random. We have heard allegations that there has been a systemic attempt by the RSF and allied Arab militias to target senior figures in Black African groups like the Masalit, forcing tens of thousands of them to flee into Chad.\n\nThe RSF says it is a revival of the ethnic violence seen in the 2000s and it is not involved.\n\nOn Thursday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) - which has been investigating crimes in Darfur since 2005 - opened a new probe into alleged war crimes in Sudan.\n\nChief prosecutor Karim Khan told the UN Security Council there was a risk of \"allowing history to repeat itself - the same miserable history\".\n\nLike the thousands of Sudanese who have fled Darfur, Maalim does not have much to return to. His home has been burned down and all his family's possessions have been looted. But most painfully, many of his friends and family will not be there.The chief executive of Thames Water has stepped down after two years in the role, weeks after giving up her bonus over sewage spills.\n\nThames Water said Sarah Bentley would leave with immediate effect, but would continue to support the firm until her replacement was found.\n\nLast month Ms Bentley said she would forgo her bonus due to the company's poor performance.\n\nRaw sewage discharges into rivers had become a problem for the firm.\n\nThames Water is the country's largest water company with around 15 million customers.\n\nIt plans to invest \u00a31.6bn in its sewage treatment works over the next two years, and has a target of reducing the total duration of discharges across London and the Thames Valley by 2030.\n\nIn a statement, Ms Bentley said it had been \"an honour to take on such a significant challenge\".\n\n\"The foundations of the turnaround that we have laid position the company for future success to improve service for customers and environmental performance.

Thames Water said it was investing in works to reduce the need for untreated discharges, including an upgrade in Marlborough.\n\nMeanwhile, the company said in March that a sewage pipe in north Swindon which has burst four times in the past two years could take years to replace. Thames Water was forced to deploy 30 tankers to pump away waste water to prevent flooding to nearby properties.\n\nThe company also apologised in January after sewage spilled over a footpath and onto a school carpark in Tadley, Hampshire, forcing people to walk through raw sewage, toilet paper and faeces. Thames Water said the spillage was \"most likely\" caused by heavy rain making the system underneath overflow.David and Jude Tebbutt were holidaying in Kenya when they came under attack by Somali pirates\n\nAn innocent man who was sentenced to death following the 2011 murder of a British tourist has had his conviction overturned at the Kenyan High Court.\n\nAli Kololo was convicted of robbery with violence in 2013, after David Tebbutt was shot dead by suspected pirates.\n\nHis sentence, later commuted to life imprisonment, has now been quashed.\n\nMr Tebbutt's wife, Jude - who has supported Mr Kololo's fight for justice - said she was \"overjoyed\".\n\nMr Tebbutt and his wife Jude were staying at a secluded beachside resort on the Kenyan coast in 2011, when they came under attack by pirates. Mr Tebbutt was killed and Mrs Tebbutt was held hostage in nearby Somalia for six months. She was only released after her adult son, Olly, negotiated a ransom deal.\n\nFollowing Ali Kololo's exoneration, Mrs Tebbutt - who has always maintained that he was not part of the gang that murdered her husband and campaigned for his release - said barely a day had gone by over the past decade when she had not thought of him.\n\n\"I'm not able to tell him face to face, but if I could, I would like to say: 'Ali I am so sorry that this happened to you and that you, your family and children have suffered so much.\n\n\"'What happened to you was not right and [was] unfair, but I hope that over time you can all make a life for yourselves and find peace,'\" Mrs Tebbutt said.\n\nJude Tebbutt, pictured in 2022, was released on 21 March 2012 after being held captive for 192 days in Somalia\n\nMr Kololo's release comes after a ten-year campaign by human rights group, Reprieve.\n\nDistinctive footwear he was allegedly wearing had been presented as crucial evidence at his 2013 trial and used to link him to the scene.\n\nBut in February 2023, at an appeal supported by Reprieve, Kenya's director of public prosecutions decided his conviction had been based on hearsay evidence about him wearing the shoes, and presented to the court without disclosure of where the information had come from.\n\nMr Kololo was then freed from Mombasa's Shimo La Tewa maximum security prison where he had been held for 11 years, pending today's judgment, which formally quashed his conviction.\n\nIn 2022 the BBC also revealed that a senior Metropolitan police officer", "As typically prevent people making trade secrets or other specified information public.\n\nThey can also apply to allegations of misbehaviour in the workplace after a settlement has been agreed, or anything likely to damage an organisation's reputation.\n\nBut like any other contract, they can not be enforced if the specified activities are illegal.\n\nIf someone breaches an NDA, they break a contract, leaving them open to being sued.\n\nBut there is a public interest defence - the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act protects whistleblowers.\n\nThe publication of the messages has sent shockwaves through the political establishment as the public inquiry into the pandemic picks up pace.\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Rishi Sunak defended the public inquiry as the \"right way\" to scrutinise the handling of the pandemic and urged people not to focus on \"piecemeal bits of information\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I have already said that the use of extreme measures is possible in case there is a danger to Russian statehood.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. They are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout.\n\nThe smallest tactical nuclear weapons can be one kiloton or less (producing the equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT). The largest ones can be as big as 100 kilotons. By comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons.\n\nThe Russian leader is meeting African leaders in St Petersburg after they visited Kyiv on Friday as part of a peace initiative they are presenting to both countries.\n\nHowever while they were in the city it came under Russian missile attack.\n\nMr Putin is also expected to hold a separate meeting with the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nThe African leaders are due to meet Mr Putin on Saturday\n\nIn Kyiv, Mr Ramaphosa called for de-escalation on both sides and negotiations for peace.\n\n\"We came here to listen and recognise what the people of Ukraine have gone through,\" he said.\n\nBut Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said instead of making diplomatic overtures to Russia it should be frozen out diplomatically to send a message that the international community condemned its invasion.\n\nKyiv would not enter negotiations with Moscow while it still occupied Ukrainian territory, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

WATCH: What is the physical toll of loneliness?\n\nA top US health official has warned the country is facing an epidemic of loneliness that is as dangerous to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\nSurgeon General Vivek Murthy told BBC News he was among millions of Americans who have experienced a \"profound sense of loneliness\".\n\nUS health authorities are calling for social isolation to be treated as seriously as obesity or drug abuse.\n\nNearly 50% of all Americans are thought to have been affected.\n\nMr Murthy said in an interview that his own battles with loneliness came during and directly after his first stint as Surgeon General ended in April 2017.\n\n\"I had neglected my family and my friends during that time, thinking that it was too hard to focus on work, and focus on family and friends,\" he said.\n\n\"I was really suffering from the consequences of that, which were a profound sense of loneliness that followed me for weeks, which stretched into months.\"\n\nLoneliness is reported to increase the risk of premature death by almost 30% - through health conditions including diabetes, heart attacks, insomnia and dementia.\n\nLack of social connection is also linked to lower academic achievement and worse performance at work, according to a new advisory.\n\nMr Murthy said that loneliness is a \"profound public health challenge\" that \"we should talk about\" and address.\n\n\"It... may surprise people to learn that the increased risk of premature death that's associated with social connection is on par with the risks that we see from smoking daily, and greater than the risk we see associated with obesity,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Why an 'epidemic' of loneliness affects health\n\nThe issue has been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, which led many people to reduce the size of their social circles.\n\nOne study quoted in the report found a 16% decrease on average in the social network size of participants from June 2019 to June 2020.\n\nIn order to tackle this, Mr Murthy has called for a collective effort to \"to mend the social fabric of our nation\" in order to \"destigmatise loneliness and change our cultural and policy response to it\".\n\nHis strategy has six pillars that include efforts to strengthen social infrastructure in communities, in part by utilising public health systems.\n\nThe advisory calls for more \"pro-connection public policies\" that are developed with the help of a research agenda to help address gaps in the data surrounding the effects of social isolation.\n\nIt also highlights the need for more data transparency from te", "he said. Gracia also paid tribute to Orta, describing him as \"honest, sincere and committed to the club\". Leicester, Leeds and Nottingham Forest are all on 30 points - one more than 19th-placed Everton Gracia, who led Watford to the FA Cup final in 2019 before spells at Valencia and Qatari side Al Sadd, won three of his 12 games in charge as Leeds manager. In a promising start they kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over Southampton in his first match at Elland Road but more recently they have been on the receiving end of a number of heavy losses. Gracia's dismissal takes the total of managerial changes in the Premier League to 15 for the season - five more than in any other previous campaign. Leeds are the fourth top-flight side to have sacked two managers this season. Allardyce to do 'all I can' Allardyce has four games to guide the Yorkshire club to safety, however Leeds have arguably the most difficult run-in among their relegation rivals with Manchester City, Newcastle United, West Ham and Tottenham to come. Having previously worked with Leeds chief executive Angus Kinnear at West Ham, Allardyce becomes Leeds' fourth manager this season, with Michael Skubala having been interim head coach prior to Gracia's appointment. Allardyce has been out of management since the end of the 2020-21 season when his West Brom side were relegated from the Premier League - the first top-flight relegation of his managerial career. Speaking to Talksport about the \"difficult games\" ahead, Allardyce said: \"We can only do what we can try and achieve, from my point of view, that is stopping the goals from going in. \"We've conceded 28 goals in the last 10 or 12 games and that has to stop if we're going to get out of trouble. We're needing to score three goals every game to win. \"If we're left to do that, that will be impossible.

John Bray fell prey to rogue traders and said he wanted to warn others not to make his mistake\n\nThree rogue traders who filmed themselves boasting about overcharging for poor roofing work have been jailed.\n\nDean Smith and brothers Matty and James Rossiter were \"rogue builders on an industrial scale\" who preyed on the elderly as they were \"easy targets\".\n\nThey made \u00a345,000 from crimes committed in 18 properties across Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Bristol.\n\nThe judge said their \"arrogance was notable\" after they laughed at a victim they called \"really old\".\n\nThe trio were jailed at Swindon Crown Court, having admitted a number of fraud offences in June.\n\nMatty, 18, and James Rossiter, 25, both of Sambourne Park, Minety, in Wiltshire admitted fraud by false representation and participating in a fraudulent business.\n\nJames Rossiter was jailed for three years and four months, while his younger brother was handed two years and three months.\n\nSmith, 21, of Paices Hill in Aldermaston, Berkshire was sentenced to three years after pleading guilty to participating in a fraudulent business.\n\nThe known offences occurred between October 2020 and March 2021.\n\nJudge Jason Taylor told them: \"Together you were rogue builders on an industrial scale.\n\n\"Over several months you mainly targeted elderly people and you viewed them as easy targets due to their vulnerability and felt no guilt about taking advantage of them.\n\n\"Your arrogance is notable.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said constitutional order in Niger should be restored, Reuters says, quoting Russia's state-owned Tass news agency.\n\nSome civil society groups in Niger have been calling for a move away from France and towards Russia in recent weeks.\n\nThe junta has reprimanded France for violating the closure of the country's borders after a military plane landed at an air-force base on Thursday morning.\n\nThis coup is yet further bad news for French and Western efforts to restore stability to the part of West Africa known as the Sahel. When neighbouring Mali chose to partner up with Russia's Wagner Group in place of the French, Paris moved its centre of operations in the region to Niger.\n\nThis coup, even if it turns out to be short-lived, has shown that even Niger cannot necessarily be relied on to be a permanent safe base. Western influence in the region is shrinking like a water pool in the dry season.\n\nThe governments in Burkina Faso, Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali have all decided they would rather work with Russia's brutal Wagner mercenaries than any Western force. Wagner's primary interests in Africa have appeared to be more about enriching themselves and extending the Kremlin's influence than following the Western goals of trying to nurture better governance.\n\nFor the two major insurgent groups in the region, those linked to so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda, this is good news. They thrive on instability, poor governance and local resentment of the government. So a coup in Niger is likely to further hamper efforts to contain them.\n\nThe takeover was announced by a spokesman, Col Maj Amadou Abdramane, who said the takeover was instigated by the deteriorating security situation \"and poor economic and social governance\".\n\nBut Niger's private L'Enqueteur newspaper has suggested the coup was prompted by President Bazoum's attempt to remove Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani as commander of the presidential guard.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

As air conditions worsen, it can become harder to breathe and cause stress on the lungs and heart, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.The government has approved the use of longer lorries on British roads, saying it will make businesses more efficient and cut emissions.\n\nThe industry welcome the move, saying it would mean more goods could be transported by fewer vehicles.\n\nOne campaign group warned the larger tail swing, meaning their rear end covers a bigger area when turning could put pedestrians and cyclists at risk.\n\nMinisters said the lorries, which have been trialled since 2011, are safe.\n\nThere are already around 3,000 such lorries in use. They are 18.55m long - which is about 2.05m longer than the standard size.\n\nHowever, from 31 May any business in England, Scotland and Wales will be permitted to use them.\n\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said the vehicles would help businesses be more productive.

Ash Regan, Kate Forbes and Humza Yousaf - in the contest, despite speculation he could endorse Mr Yousaf.\n\nHowever, when Ms Forbes said she would not have voted for gay marriage if she had been an MSP at the time, Mr Swinney intervened to say he profoundly disagreed with her despite having \"deep religious faith\" himself.\n\nHe questioned whether it would be appropriate for someone with her views to be SNP leader.\n\nMr Swinney has been Nicola Sturgeon's deputy for more than eight years\n\nMr Swinney was born in Edinburgh and has been an SNP stalwart for decades, having joined the party at the age of 15.\n\nBy the time he was 22 he was national secretary, and served in a series of increasingly senior roles before winning the North Tayside seat at Westminster in 1997.\n\nTwo years later he headed to Holyrood, and allowing for some boundary tweaks has represented the same patch of Perthshire ever since - one of only three MSPs with continuous service of one constituency since 1999.\n\nMr Swinney's rise through the ranks of the SNP was complete in 2000, when he was elected leader following the (first) departure of Alex Salmond.\n\nHowever, his leadership was not a great success for the party and he stood down, saying that the SNP was \"not yet seen as an alternative government in waiting\".\n\nThree years later Alex Salmond took the SNP into power in Scotland and Mr Swinney was handed a key role as finance secretary.\n\nHe kept that role when Nicola Sturgeon became first minister after the 2014 independence referendum defeat, as well as becoming deputy first minister.\n\nAfter the 2016 election Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her team, moving Mr Swinney to education.\n\nIn 2021, he became Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Swinney said it had been the privilege of his life to serve in the Scottish Government since 2007.\n\nMs Sturgeon replied: \"Your contribution to our nation, almost 16 years in government is considerable, indeed unique.\n\n\"Therefore, while I - perhaps more than most - completely understand your decision, I still felt a real sense of sadness when you told me of it.\"\n\nJohn Swinney's departure from the front benches was perhaps not unexpected, after he decided against running for the leadership himself.\n\nBut his presence will be sorely missed by whoever gets the job, given his deep knowledge of parliament and government.\n\nJust between John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP will have almost 50 years of front-line experience sitting on the backbenches.\n\nPerhaps old instincts will kick in and the pair will engage in intense competition for the deputy convenership of the local government committee.\n\nBut they will both be keen not to cast a shadow over the new administration -

It's not just a football issue, it's a life that people go through every single day.\"\n\nReal have reported the abuse towards the 22-year-old to the Spanish prosecutor's office as a hate crime.\n\nPolice in Spain said on Tuesday they had detained three people in connection with racist abuse directed at the player Sunday's game.\n\nOn Monday the lights on the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro were switched off for an hour, in cooperation with the Brazilian FA and the Observatory of Racial Discrimination in Football.\n\nThe Archdiocesan Sanctuary, which manages the monument, said it \"repudiates\" the racism faced by Vinicius, adding: \"The lighting of the monument will be switched off as a symbol of the collective fight against racism and in solidarity with the player and all those who suffer prejudice around the world.\"\n\nVinicius said on Instagram: \"Black and strong. May this image of a statue of Christ symbolise our struggle. Thanks so much for all the love. I will always be ready to fight for our ideals.\"\n\n'What chance do we have?'\n\nRichards said measures to try and curb racism in the game were \"not working\".\n\n\"People don't care enough and that is the problem,\" he added. \"If people cared they would do something about it.\n\n\"It's not about taking the knee or wearing Kick it Out shirts because it's not working. I'm tired of having to talk about the same things that happens over and over again.\n\n\"We have spoken enough. The people who need to sort themselves out are the ones who are being racist. Until harsher punishments are delivered it's always going to be the same.\n\n\"If Javier thinks like that, what chance do we have?\"\n\nFellow pundit and former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton called for Tebas to be removed from his position.\n\n\"When you have someone in such a powerful position, to have a Twitter spat with Vinicius Jr, to tell him he is wrong, it's glaringly obvious to everyone there needs to be change in that position,\" he said.\n\n'It's not football, it's inhuman'\n\nIn a new social media post on Monday, Vinicius listed the instances of abuse he has suffered this season and said they were not \"isolated cases\".\n\n\"What is missing to criminalize these people? And punish the clubs sportively? Why don't the sponsors charge La Liga? Don't the televisions bother to broadcast this barbarity every weekend?\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"The problem is very serious, and press releases don't work anymore. Neither does blaming me to justify criminal acts. It's not football, it's inhuman.\"\n\nCommenting on the post on Instagram, Burnley manager and former Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany wrote: \"My heart is bleeding when I see these images.\n\n\"So much has already been endured by our fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers\u2026 and still the fight is not over. Our children will not grow up in a world where discrimination and hate prevails. They will know their worth and they will never bow down to those who chose to discriminate, separate and hate. Vinicius, You Are Not Alone. We stand together and we are stronger than ever.\"\n\nSeptember 2022 - Some Atletico Madrid fans sang racist songs toward Vinicius outside their Wanda Metropolitano stadium before Real Madrid played them in September 2022. Atletico Madrid later condemned \"unacceptable\" chants by a \"minority\" of fans.\n\nSeptember 2022 - some pundits in Spain criticise Vinicius' goal celebration, in which he dances by corner flag. He responds by saying \"the happiness of a black Brazilian in Europe\" is behind the criticism.\n\nDecember 2022 - Vinicius appeared to be subjected to racist abuse at Valladolid while he walked past fans after being substituted. La Liga said it has filed charges relating to the racist abuse of Vinicius to the \"relevant judicial, administrative and sporting bodies\".\n\nJanuary 2023 - An effigy of the Real Madrid winger", "Ms Brown claimed, wrongly, that it was \"passed unanimously\" by MSPs in 2021.\n\nThe bill did have cross-party support at Holyrood from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens but, after five hours of heated debate, a Labour trio of Johann Lamont, Jenny Marra and Elaine Smith joined the Conservatives in voting against it, while the SNP's Joan McAlpine and Alex Neil abstained.\n\nMs Brown also gave mixed signals about whether or not misgendering would be a crime, flitting between \"not at all\" and: \"It could be reported and it could be investigated. Whether or not the police would think it was criminal is up to Police Scotland.\"\n\nThe minister also repeatedly claimed that the legal threshold for a hate crime was behaviour that was both \"threatening and abusive,\" an inaccuracy that prompted campaigners against the legislation to lodge a complaint with the Scottish government.\n\nIf the minister had a torrid week so too did Police Scotland which, as senior officers had predicted, was flooded with thousands of complaints under the new legislation.\n\nBoth the force and Humza Yousaf's government had engaged in a widespread publicity campaign, with billboards encouraging people to report hate crimes.\n\nThat was a double-edged sword, with the first minister saying on Thursday that he was \"very, very concerned\" about the \"flurry of vexatious complaints.\"\n\nAs well as additional work for a police force already under pressure, the potential of being reported for posting on social media worries even some of those who regard the legislation as reasonably well-drafted.\n\nWarnings about a \"chilling effect\" on free speech date back at least as far as the publication of John Stuart Mill's famous essay, On Liberty, in 1859.\n\nProf Adam Tomkins said: \"What the chilling effect means is that people feel that they shouldn't say something because they worry about what the potential consequences might be.\"\n\nFormer Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins voted against the bill\n\nIn that sense the Hate Crime Act feeds into the culture wars \u2014 ideological battles between different groups over morality and identity, as distinct from traditional left-right political struggles over economics.\n\nThe strategic question for the Scottish National Party is whether or not it could or should have dodged these wars, putting a sharper focus on bread-and-butter issues rather than on social reforms such as trying to make it easier to change gender.\n\n\"On the doorsteps,\" wrote Joanna Cherry in the National this week, \"I hear real anger from constituents who think too much time is spent on virtue-signalling and not enough on the issues they care most about, such as health, transport, housing, and education.\"\n\n\"I wish the post-2014 leadership of the SNP had spent half as much time on advancing the cause of independence as they have on identity politics,\" she added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Explained: Why has Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law proved controversial?\n\nMr Yousaf has stoutly defended his and predecessor Nicola Sturgeon's approach to these issues.\n\nReferring to the fact that a large number of complaints to police this week related to a speech he had given about racial disparities in Scotland, he said: \"I'm not going to let them stop me from continuing to speak out about racism or talk about that fact that we need more diversity in public life.\"\n\nThe first minister is not alone.\n\nScottish Trans, which advocates for \"equality, rights and inclusion\" for trans people, is among the organisations supporting both gender recognition reform and the new hate crime law.\n\nBut the charity's manager, Vic Valentine, also defended freedom of speech, saying the act would be unlikely to quieten the noise \"that can sometimes feel deafening if you are a trans person facing it every day\".\n\nVic Valentine from Scottish Trans supports the new law\n\nThere may be more noise to come. The culture wars in Scotland are far from over.\n\nThe Scottish government has promised to introduce a separate Misogyny Act to tackle hatred and harassment of women by the time of the next Holyrood elections in 2026.\n\nAlthough there is considerable support for this idea among women's groups, the devil will be in the detail, and another gender-related flashpoint about the definition of the word \"woman\" seems highly likely.\n\nOn top of that, the Scottish government is proposing to ban conversion therapy, which has been described as \"any treatment, practice or effort that aims to change, suppress and/or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression\".\n\nA public consultation on its plans closed this week, the day after the hate crime law came into force, and is already provoking debate.\n\nA ban has also been discussed in England and Wales, although the UK government left it out of the King's Speech setting out its legislative priorities in November - a reminder that Scotland is not the only place where the culture wars are being fought.\n\nInternal pressure for social liberalisation tends to be more intense in parties of the left than of the right and if the UK emerges from the next general election with a Labour government, party leader Sir Keir Starmer might find that those culture wars are winding their way to Downing Street, whether he likes it or not.Alena, from Westray, says she would be keen to have the test for the gene\n\nPeople on the Orkney island of Westray are to be offered testing to find out if they have a gene variant which can lead to a higher risk of breast cancer.\n\nA landmark study found a specific mutation of the BRCA1 gene which could have begun with a single individual in Westray hundreds of years ago.\n\nResearchers found that about one in 100 people with Orkney grandparents had the specific gene variant.\n\nMost can trace their ancestry back to Westray, which has a population of 600.\n\nResidents of the outer Orkney island met on Thursday night as the study was published to try to better understand the implication of its findings.\n\nAll adults with Westray grandparents, living in Westray, will be offered a genetic test for Orkney variant - BRCA1 V1736A.\n\nThere are many other BRCA gene variants which can leave women at a higher risk of ovarian and breast cancer but this is believed to be the first time a geographic ancestral link has been made within the UK.\n\nAcross the UK about 1 in 1,000 people have a BRCA1 mutation and women can get genetic testing if they know of a direct family connection to the gene or have a history of ovarian or breast cancer in their family.\n\nOn Westray, women welcomed the identification of the gene and were keen to get tested.\n\nMarian Groat, who runs the runs the shop and caf\u00e9 in Pierowall on Westray, said: \"I think you would be silly not to take up the chance to find out.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old, whose grandmother died from breast cancer, said: \"I have a daughter and I would be happy to have it explored as fully as I could.\n\n\"I think that when you are faced with a fact like that it can't be ignored. I don't think hiding away or head in the sand will help the matter.\"\n\nMichelle says the sooner you find out something like that the better\n\nThe genetic screening is usually undertaken by swabbing the mouth for saliva. It can be self-administered.\n\nMichelle, 52, from Westray, told the BBC: \"I don't think the test is very difficult, it is completely painless, it does not cost anything, so I think why not?\n\n\"The sooner you find out something like that the better.\"\n\nHer friend Alena said: \"If you were to be carrying it then you can do things about it.\n\n\"I have one daughter so it would give the opportunity to have her tested if it were the case.\"\n\nOptions for those with the gene include risk-reducing surgery such as a mastectomy.\n\nBut the NHS advises awareness of changes to breasts, annual breast screenings and MRI scans to help detect breast cancer, while lifestyle changes like healthy eating and exercise can \"sometimes reduce risk\".\n\nThere is currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer.\n\nWhile people on the island whose grandparents were from Westray will be tested, there will be people around the UK and the world who also carry the gene.\n\nAt a playgroup in the Orkney mainland town of Kirkwall, women said they would like to get tested for the gene.\n\nUrsula Thomson said the higher risk was", "good at pulling people in\".\n\n\"He worked tirelessly, he was a radio man, not just somebody who turned up, did the show and went home.

Repair work from the damage done during that incident is continuing.\n\nThroughout Saturday, a man could be seen on the scaffold wearing a Spider-Man mask and shouting intermittently at officers on the ground. Footage also appeared to show him hitting the statue with a hammer and chisel.\n\nA cordon was put in place and police initially said it was not possible to \"safely detain the man given the circumstances of the incident, including the height\".\n\nThey added that specialist officers were attending the scene.\n\nThe statue was damaged in January 2022 by a protester\n\nBorn in 1882, Gill became an influential artist whose work included several large sculptures for buildings in central London, including Westminster Cathedral and the original headquarters of the London Underground.\n\nHe was also the designer of Gill Sans, a widely used British typeface.\n\nGill died in 1940, but in 1989 a biography was published detailing diary entries in which he described sex abuse committed against his two eldest daughters, an incestuous relationship with his sister, and sex acts carried out on his dog.\n\nThe statue outside Broadcasting House, installed in 1933, features the characters Prospero", "to ban imports of animal hunting trophies to Great Britain are set to become law.\n\nThe government has backed legislation which would stop hunters bringing back body parts of thousands of species, including lions, rhinos, elephants and polar bears, killed abroad.\n\nTory MP Henry Smith, who proposed the bill, said it would help conserve the world's most endangered species.\n\nIt was approved by MPs and will now face further scrutiny in the Lords.\n\nAs it has the support of the government, the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill is likely to become law.\n\nEvery year, hunters from the UK travel abroad, often to southern Africa, and pay thousands of pounds to legally shoot animals, such as lions and elephants.\n\nUnder current rules, with the right paperwork, they can then bring trophies, such as stuffed heads or horns, back to the UK.\n\nCampaigners backing the bill had feared it could be blocked after more than 30 amendments were tabled by two Conservative MPs, Sir Christopher Chope and Sir Bill Wiggin.\n\nHowever, after the government accepted two of their proposals - to establish an advisory board on hunting trophies and to limit the power of the secretary of state to add new species to the list the ban would apply to - the pair dropped their other demands for further changes to the bill.\n\nCritics of the plans have argued that profits from hunting are used to pay for conservation projects in African countries and can ultimately help to protect endangered species.\n\nSir Bill, the Tory MP for North Herefordshire, told the Commons there were concerns that removing the revenue supplied by trophy hunters could \"open the floodgate to poachers, who will cause far more cruelty and pain to the animals and will pose a far greater threat to endangered species\".\n\nHowever, animal welfare charities have rejected this, arguing that hardly any of the revenues from trophy hunting ever reach local communities.\n\nEnvironment Minister Trudy Harrison told MPs: \"I do recognise that some of the income from trophy hunting has contributed towards the protection of habitat and the prevention of poaching.\n\n\"But to bring [back] the body parts of endangered species\u2026 is not the way forward.\"\n\nSinger Ed Sheeran is among the celebrities who have backed the bill\n\nSir Bill also suggested the legislation was a \"a neo-colonial attempt to control conservation management programmes of African democratic countries\".\n\nThis was denied by Mr Smith, who insisted: \"This is about the values that we in Britain have, that we do not want to be part of a trade in endangered species' body parts.\n\n\"We are not telling other countries how to run their trade, or their conservation or hunting policies.\"\n\nSome MPs, including the Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson, also raised concerns Northern Ireland could become a \"back door\" for hunting imports as the law would not apply there.\n\nMs Harrison said the government would do \"everything we possibly can\" to ensure Northern Ireland was not a \"stepping stone for imports to Great Britain\".\n\nExplorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, singer Ed Sheeran and actress Dame Judi Dench are among the celebrities who have backed the proposed legislation.\n\nAnimal charities welcomed the progress of the bill, with Born Free saying it sent \"a clear signal that, with wildlife in crisis, allowing rich people to kill wild animals for kicks has no place in the modern world\".\n\nHumane Society International said it was \"relieved\" only two amendments to the bill were accepted, although the charity added that it was disappointed one removed the power of the environment secretary to add other species in need of protection to the legislation.A more detailed survey of the number of newts in the pond at Cavers Castle is being carried out\n\nPlans to restore a roofless, crumbling castle in the Scottish Borders have been held up by great crested newts.\n\nThe presence of the protected species in a pond at Cavers Castle, near Hawick, has delayed a decision on a bid to bring it back into use.\n\nThe council's planning committee was being recommended to approve the application for the site.\n\nHowever, it deferred a decision to get a \"handle on the full population\" of newts in the pond.\n\nThe castle was demolished by explosives in the 1950s\n\nParts of Cavers Castle, also known as Cavers House, are believed to date back to the 15th or 16th Centuries.\n\nThe building was substantially extended in about 1750, followed by a \"massive redesign and remodel\" in the late 19th Century.\n\nWhen one of the last owners died in 1949, a buyer could not be found for the property so its contents were auctioned off and much of it demolished by explosives in 1953.\n\nThe planning committee met to discuss its fate last month but deferred a decision for a site visit.\n\nNow the discovery of the newts has put the decision on hold again.\n\nScottish Borders Council's principal planning officer Craig Miller told councillors: \"After the last committee we did receive an indication that there may be a European Protected Species within the pond at the south end of the site.\n\n\"The applicant was asked to carry out a pond survey and that was carried out and passed to the ecology officer confirming that the species was present in the pond.\n\n\"The survey did not contain enough detail or land searches to ascertain how many of the protected species were using the site and we need to get a handle on the full population\".\n\nA decision on the plans to bring the building back into use has been delayed\n\nMembers agreed to defer a final decision until a more detailed survey had been carried out.\n\nThe committee will meet again in August but they were told there was no guarantee the information would be available in time for that.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Rishi Sunak is facing questions over shares his wife holds in a childcare agency that could benefit from a new policy unveiled in the Budget.\n\nThe Chancellor announced a pilot of payments for new childminders with more for those who sign through agencies.\n\nAkshata Murty was listed as a shareholder in one of those agencies, Koru Kids, as recently as 6 March.\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary said all Mr Sunak's interests \"have been declared in the usual way\".\n\nMinisters are expected to provide a written list of all financial interests that might \"give rise to a conflict\".\n\nMr Sunak mentions Ms Murthy's venture capital company, Catamaran Ventures, in his list of ministerial interests, but does not mention Koru Kids.\n\nThe PM also did not mention Ms Murthy's links to Koru Kids when he was questioned by MPs over the policy at a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\nLabour MP Catherine McKinnell asked Mr Sunak whether he had any interest to declare, and in reply he said: \"No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say there are \"are serious questions for Rishi Sunak to answer\" about \"any extra income his family could receive from his own government's policy\", and have urged the government's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate Mr Sunak over a potential breach of ministerial rules.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Sunak must explain why his wife's shareholding \"was not deemed necessary to publish in the register of members' interests\".\"He must urgently correct the record and set out what steps he took to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interest,\" Ms Rayner said.\n\nWhen asked about Ms Murty's shareholding - which was reported by the i newspaper - Mr Sunak's press secretary told reporters the details of Ms Murthy's holding in the agency were not in the public domain, but indicated they would be included in the updated statement of ministers' interests, due out in May.\n\n\"The ministerial code sets out a process by which ministers declare their interests. They do that in writing, in this case to the Cabinet Secretary. That process was followed to the letter by the prime minister,\" the press secretary said.\n\nDeclarations to the Cabinet Office are not immediately available to MPs or others to see.\n\nPressed that MPs are usually expected to draw attention to an interest they have declared if questioned about it in a committee, Mr Sunak's press secretary said \"there was not a specific interest that was put to him\".\n\nThe BBC has sought to ask both the company and Ms Murthy for comment.\n\nThe pilot of bonuses for childminders was announced in the Budget on 15 March as part of the government", "selling session with the university's wellbeing service and said he was feeling suicidal.\n\nThis was his last engagement with the service and he died days later.\n\nAn inquest into his death is due to be held in the autumn.\n\nA university spokesman said: \"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Charlie's friends and family at such an extremely difficult time.\n\n\"While we cannot go into individual circumstances, our student wellbeing team were in contact with Charlie throughout the 22-23 academic year, with the aim of providing direct support as well as linking to statutory NHS health and mental health services where appropriate.\"\n\nEmma Laney says Charlie (left) was \"an amazing big brother\" to Max and Angel\n\nEmma said she had \"an overwhelming sense that something wasn't right\" so asked Charlie's dad to contact the university, which is when it was discovered that Charlie was dead.\n\nShe said: \"I feel a lot more should have been done. A lot more communication, sharing of information. I mean if they'd just contacted home or even a professional mental health then, you know, it could have been a different outcome.\"\n\nRomana Nemcov\u00e1, 22, was Charlie's girlfriend and is now one of the organisers of the Charlie Asked For Help campaign, which was set up by fellow students to demand the university changes how it handles cases like this.\n\nShe said: \"It's really important because Charlie was an incredible person. I want to make a change for future students so, future students will not suffer how he suffered.\n\n\"He could still be here if he'd had help and that's the most difficult part for me.\"\n\nEmma Laney feels something could have been done to save her son's life\n\nThe Charlie Asked For Help campaigners say students need clearer communication with wellbeing services, as well as help to register with a GP practice when they start university.\n\nRachael Eagles, chief executive of Area 43, a mental health charity based in Ceredigion, said there were not enough services to meet demand.\n\n\"We need to decide what the gold standard of mental health services and care looks like and then ensure access to that wherever you are,\" she said.\n\nThis \"gold standard\" is something the National Union of Students Wales wants the Welsh government to implement at all universities in to ensure a \"consistent model\" of support.\n\nThe Welsh government said: \"We have established an expert group to provide advice on how to improve access to mental health services and ensure universities across Wales have consistent and accessible support for students.\"\n\nAberystwyth University said it was \"continuously\" reviewing its processes and updating practices to ensure it was giving students \"the best support possible\".\n\nIf you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line.Chancellor Scholz (right) pledged to support President Zelensky (left) and Ukraine \"for as long as it is necessary\"\n\nUkraine has no plans to hit targets in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said in Germany, where Kyiv secured a big new defence aid package.\n\n\"We are not attacking Russian territory,\" he said after talks in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\n\"We are preparing a counterattack to de-occupy the illegitimately conquered territories,\" Mr Zelensky added.\n\nMr Scholz vowed to back Ukraine \"for as long as it is necessary\", promising \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.4bn) worth of weapons.\n\nThis includes advanced German Leopard tanks and more anti-aircraft systems to defend Ukraine from almost daily deadly Russian missile and drone attacks.\n\nPresident Zelensky described the new tranche as \"the largest since the beginning of the full-scale aggression\" by Russia in February 2022.\n\nThe war has transformed Germany's attitude towards Ukraine, moving from being a reluctant supplier of military hardware to virtually doubling its contribution overnight, the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin says.\n\nRussia accuses Ukraine of repeatedly hitting targets inside Russia, including a reported drone attack on Moscow's Kremlin earlier this month.\n\nUkraine denies the accusations, while also stressing that it has a legitimate right to use force and other means to fully de-occupy its territories currently under Russian control. These include four regions in the south and east, as well as the Crimea peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.\n\nLater on Sunday, President Zelensky travelled to the western city of Aachen to receive the prestigious Charlemagne Prize awarded this year to him and the Ukrainian people. The honour is given for efforts to foster European unity.\n\n\"Ukraine incarnates everything the European idea is living for: the courage of convictions, the fight for values and freedom, the commitment to peace and unity,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the award ceremony.\n\nIn other developments on Sunday:\n\nPresident Zelensky flew to Germany from Italy overnight, his plane escorted by two German Air Force fighter jets.\n\nIn Rome, the Ukrainian leader met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He also had a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff said he was constantly praying for peace in Ukraine.\n\nThe Pope also stressed the urgent need to help \"the most fragile people, innocent victims\" of the Russian invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Meloni assured Mr Zelensky of Rome's support for united Ukraine.\n\nLater on Sunday, the Ukrainian leader arrived in Paris, where he went to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for a working dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron.The cost of getting a manicure will increase on Monday, as thousands of nail technicians across the UK come together to raise their prices.\n\nThe Nail Tech Org, which is behind the National Nail Price Increase Day movement, said its members were making about \u00a37 per hour, below the minimum wage of \u00a311.44.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily want to, but we\u2019ve got to live as well,\u201d said Ellie Jenkins, a self-employed nail technician.Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nNewcastle United leapfrogged Manchester United into third place in the Premier League table after avenging their Carabao Cup final defeat against the Red Devils.\n\nThe Magpies produced a magnificent display at a raucous St James' Park to leave their opponents without a win - or a goal - in their past three top-flight games.\n\nNewcastle were thwarted by David de Gea's excellent first-half double save, the Spaniard showing quick reactions to deny Joe Willock after clawing away Alexander Isak's header.\n\nWillock wasted another glorious chance after finishing wildly but the former Arsenal midfielder was in the right place to nod home the opener after Bruno Guimaraes' cross was headed across goal by Allan Saint-Maximin.\n\nManchester United, who failed to register an attempt on target in the first half, have not tasted victory in the Premier League since ending their six-year trophy drought at Wembley in February.\n\nWout Weghorst fired an early chance into the side netting but the Red Devils were second best to a Newcastle side that showed far more urgency.\n\nThe hosts deservedly doubled their lead in the 88th minute with a well-placed header by substitute Callum Wilson.\n\u2022 None 'We owed Man Utd one' - Burn & Newcastle on a mission\n\u2022 None Go straight to all the best Newcastle content\n\nNewcastle have Champions League in their sights\n\nNewcastle have not finished in the Premier League's top four since 2002-03 but that could be set to change after a standout win against rivals for European qualification.\n\nThe stylish Magpies would have won by a more handsome margin had De Gea not pushed Joelinton's attempt on to the bar, while Fabian Schar's follow-up was cleared off the line.\n\nIn a game played at a frantic pace, Eddie Howe's side were slicker than their opponents as they made it three league wins in a row.\n\nNewcastle's fans cheered and waved black-and-white flags at full-time but Howe knows his team have more work to do if they are to play in the Champions League next season.\n\nHowever, the signs look good. This win was achieved without leading scorer Miguel Almiron who remains injured while Nick Pope produced his 13th clean sheet of the season.\n\nThe Newcastle keeper did not have much to do thanks to the work of his defenders, with Dan Burn producing a monumental", "proud\" of Lauren's performance.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis said James has the \"poise, quality and technique\" to hurt teams in the way she did to score the winner.\n\nEx-Lioness Fara Williams said James was \"the only bright spark\".\n\n\"She kicked things off with the early goal, which really set us on our way [to the win],\" Williams told BBC One.\n\n\"After the initial 20-minute period, the only quality from then on really came from Lauren James. For someone so young to control the rhythm of the team is impressive, some of the more experienced players need to take a leaf out of her book.\"\n\nWilliams also praised Wiegman's set-up, which allowed James \"a licence to roam\".\n\n\"She brought rhythm to England's play, recognising when to burst up the pitch, when to slow the play down and when to bring the ball back.\n\n\"When she comes in-field she gets into the pockets we want her in. Her goal is exceptional - the finish is unbelievable and the keeper wasn't getting anywhere near it.\n\n\"It certainly got me off my seat. I was jumping around the room.\"It's time US writers asserted their rights - Cox\n\nLaura is chatting to the panel about what we've just heard - and actor Brian Cox says he \"absolutely\" agrees with Tom Hollander that striking writers in the US should \"go for it\". Cox says: \"They are the prime forces of what we do - we can't do anything without the writers\". He adds: \"Unfortunately producers are the ones who behave rather badly, they are the ones who are the manipulators and sometimes the writers get pushed to the tap end of the bath. \"It's time they asserted their rights,\" he says. The huge successes of The White Lotus and Succession is down to the writers, he says - \"they're the ones who have done it.\" On the wealth and opulence depicted in these shows he says \"everybody loves to hate and these are extremely hateful people\".It's estimated there are fewer than 30 breeding pairs of barn owls left in Northern Ireland\n\nOne of Northern Ireland's most vulnerable farmland birds saw a huge increase in the number of chicks and breeding pairs last year.\n\nTwenty-four barn owl chicks were born in 2022 from eight breeding pairs - six times the number of chicks born in 2021, according to Ulster Wildlife.\n\nTwo new nest sites were also discovered in County Down last year.\n\nThe conservation charity estimates that there are fewer than 30 breeding pairs left in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe barn owl is one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds and is red-listed on the Irish Birds of Conservation Concern and protected under the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nUlster Wildlife said the barn owl was \"under serious threat\" in Northern Ireland - with the population declining drastically since the 1930s.\n\nBut, according to the charity, there are reasons to be hopeful after a wet spring and hot summer in 2021 resulted in a poor breeding season.\n\nIn 2021, there were only two known broods recorded but that increased to eight in 2022. The same year, four chicks were born.\n\nTwenty-four barn owl chicks were born in Northern Ireland in 2022, compared to four in 2021\n\nThe charity published its 2022 barn owl report on Wednesday.\n\nKaty Bell, a senior conservation officer at Ulster Wildlife, said they were delighted \"to see the fortunes of barn owls changing\" after a troubled 2021.\n\n\"Every time we think the population is increasing we lose some of our breeding pairs so this year's news is very positive,\" Ms Bell said.\n\n\"Barn owls need a number of things to survive. Plenty of wildlife-friendly habitat on farms with enough small mammals to eat, places to nest and roost, as well as climatic stability.\n\n\"All of these factors play a part in their success and a big part of our work to help this species recover is advising landowners and farmers on habitat improvements and putting up artificial nest boxes.\n\n\"It is great to see this paying dividends in 2022, providing a welcome boost for our small and struggling barn owl population.\"\n\nBarn owls struggled to breed in 2021 due to a wet spring and hot summer\n\nBarn owls face a number of pressures including loss of habitat for hunting and nesting, extreme weather, poisoning from rodenticides and road traffic collisions, according to Ulster Wildlife.\n\nThey also struggle to hunt in extreme weather conditions.\n\nTheir soft feathers are not waterproof, so excessive rainy, cold or windy conditions can be disastrous for a breeding pair.\n\nLikewise, a prolonged dry summer can have a major impact on both their prey and the chicks themselves.\n\nUlster wildlife erected 20 man-made nest boxes last year to help boost the bird's fragile population\n\nDuring its survey last year, Ulster Wildlife carried out 34 visits to landowners to advise on ideal barn owl habitat.\n\nThey also erected 20 man-made nest boxes in suitable locations to replace the loss of natural nesting sites in barns, old buildings and tree cavities.\n\nSeventy-six nest-boxes were also checked across the countryside last summer for signs of barn owl activity, as well as surveying 11 potential new breeding sites.\n\nMs Bell said there was the potential in 2023 to build on the success of the barn owl conservation work.\n\n\"We want to find more nest sites, support more landowners and nest-minders, create a network of habitats and nest boxes and ultimately help protect and expand our population of barn owls,\" she said.\n\n\"Sightings of these elusive birds are really important to help target our efforts so we would encourage anyone to get in touch.\"Rescue workers waded through the flooded roads of the village of Nantgarw in Rhondda Cynon Taf during Storm Dennis\n\nWelsh ministers have been accused of lacking urgency on flood risks due to climate change, after postponing planning rule changes twice.\n\nThe policy, based on the latest advice, was due to come into force next month, but the minister said that was no longer \"achievable\".\n\nOpposition parties and environmental campaigners have expressed concern at the delay.\n\nThe Welsh government said it was important to \"get it right\".\n\nMinisters want to update the planning rules, known as TAN 15, to reflect the risk of flooding and ensure future development considers the potential impact of climate change.\n\nThe new policy will require developers and councils to consult maps produced by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) that show projected as well as current risk levels.\n\nThe government had intended to introduce the new rules on 1 December 2021, but a week beforehand they were postponed after councils raised concerns.\n\nThe village of Crickhowell was cut off after the river Usk bursts its banks during Storm Dennis\n\nAt the time, Minister for Climate Change Julie James said the delay was to \"enable local planning authorities to consider fully the impact of climate change projections,\" and that the rules would come into force on 1 June 2023.\n\n\"There would be no further extension,\" she warned.\n\nHowever last week, Ms James wrote to Senedd members (MSs) saying that date would \"no longer be achievable,\" and it that it was \"unlikely\" the changes would happen \"before the end of this year\".\n\nShe said this was because the government was still considering responses to a new consultation carried out on revised proposals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Record river levels following intense storms show how climate change is affecting Wales\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Politics Wales programme, the Welsh Conservatives' climate change spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders described the delay as \"unacceptable\".\n\nPlaid Cymru MS Heledd Fychan said the postponement was \"not helping those living at the continued risk of flooding\".\n\n\"The planning system needs to be reformed, needs to be changed, this is a long time coming and should already be in place,\" she added.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners have also expressed concern at the delay, with", "balls\" like him.\n\nTheatre directors would not accept someone like me now, Sir Mark Rylance has said.\n\nReflecting on how he would be received in today's industry, Sir Mark said acting used to be more accepting of \"oddballs\" like him.\n\nWhile directors \"understandably\" want actors who are \"easy to work with\", it can \"also be a loss\", he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nSir Mark was knighted for his services to theatre in 2017.\n\nHe said: \"I'm not a doctor, I'm an artist, but I remember when I first came into the theatre in 1980, I feel like there were a lot more kind of oddballs and difficult people in the theatre. And I think on film sets too.\n\n\"Now I regularly, understandably, meet directors who only want people who are easy to work with, they don't want anyone difficult, they don't want anything like that.\n\n\"And I think that also can be a loss.\"\n\nAsked what he was like as a younger actor, Sir Mark said he was \"temperamental, moody and difficult to understand\".\n\n\"I think today I might have got a bad reputation and not been welcomed into work,\" he added.\n\nSir Mark Rylance after he was knighted by the Duke of Cambridge\n\nSir Mark, who won his third Tony award for his performance as Olivia in the Globe Theatre's all-male performance of Twelfth Night in 2013, also said he \"doubts\" he will play a woman again.\n\n\"It's not where society is at the moment,\" he added.\n\nHe said he was pleased to see that \"things have improved\" for actors from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nRecalling when he first joined RADA and the RSC in the late 70s and early 80s, he said there were not any actors from the African diaspora in the company.\n\n\"Things have improved. Now it's unthinkable that anyone other than someone from the African diaspora would play Othello for example,\" he added.\n\nSir Mark's acting career has spanned four decades, winning him an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Olivier Awards and three Tony Awards.The company behind the websites Vice and Motherboard has filed for bankruptcy in the US and is set to be sold to a group of its lenders.\n\nVice Media Group - which was valued at $5.7bn (\u00a34.5bn) in 2017 - could be taken over for $225m.\n\nThe youth-focused digital publisher said it will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process.\n\nIt added that it \"expects to emerge as a financially healthy and stronger company in two to three months\".\n\nLaunched in 1994 as a fringe magazine called Voice of Montreal by Shane Smith, Gavin McInnes and Suroosh Alvi, Vice currently operates in more than 30 countries.\n\nIt was once heralded as part of vanguard of companies set to disrupt the traditional media landscape with edgy, youth-focused content spanning print, events, music, online, TV and feature films.\n\nAfter a visit to the Brooklyn-based firm's office in 2012, media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeted: \"Who's heard of VICE media?

Vice's plans to go public through a merger also failed.\n\n\"The issue with Vice and all similar websites is that they never really worked out a business model for free online journalism,\" Joseph Teasdale, head of technology at Enders Analysis, told the BBC.\n\nWebsites like Vice came along at the same time as the first dotcom boom was in its infancy and technology start-ups were springing up.\n\n\"There was a tendency at the time to treat everything like software, where you do your investment up front, attract a bunch of users, and then eventually when you're big enough you become incredibly profitable,\" he said.\n\n\"But it turns out content doesn't work like that - if you want people to keep coming back to your website, or to reach new people in new markets, you have to keep spending to make new content.\"\n\nAnd some of Vice's content was \"pretty expensive journalism\", Mr Teasdale said, involving global trips.\n\nLast month, Vice announced layoffs after its flagship TV programme was shut down.\n\nBuzzFeed, another pioneering online platform, also recently announced that it was shutting down its news division and laying off 15% of its workforce amid serious financial challenges and a slump in advertising revenue.\n\nVice Media has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a procedure which postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business.\n\nAnnouncing the bankruptcy move, Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, Vice's co-chief executive officers, said: \"This accelerated court-supervised sale process will strengthen the company and position Vice for long-term growth.\"\n\nVice's lenders have approved $20m of funding to keep the firm going through the bankruptcy process. During this time, other firms can submit \"higher or better\" bids for the media company.\n\nIf these offers are not successful, Vice Media's lenders will acquire the publisher for $225m.\n\nThe sale process is expected to take about two to three months.William J Burns said the failure of the Ukraine war risked undermining Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia\n\nThe Ukraine war is having a \"corrosive\" effect on Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia, according to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nRussian disaffection over the war is providing new opportunities for the CIA to collect intelligence, the agency's Director William J Burns said.\n\nAmerica's top spy made the comments while delivering the annual lecture at the Ditchley Foundation in the UK.\n\nHe was speaking a week after the mutiny by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nMr Burns said everyone had been \"riveted\" by the scenes last Saturday of Prigozhin's \"armed challenge\" to Moscow, when his Wagner mercenary forces marched towards Russia's capital.\n\nPrigozhin's actions were \"a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin's war on his own society and his own regime\", he said.\n\nThe CIA director said the impact not just of Prigozhin's actions but also his statements - which included an indictment of both the rationale and execution of Russia's invasion - would play out for some time.\n\n\"Disaffection with the war will continue to gnaw away at the Russian leadership,\" Mr Burns said in his prepared remarks.\n\n\"That disaffection creates a once in a generation opportunity for us at CIA,\" referring to the role of the agency in recruiting human agents to provide intelligence.\n\n\"We are not letting it go to waste,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"We are very much open for business.\"\n\nThe CIA has recently launched", "capture it and had fled the field.\n\nPolice have appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.\n\nMr McDougall has grown his flock from a handful of sheep on rented land.\n\nHe used to supplement his income by doing fencing but has been unable to do so since damaging his spinal chord two years ago.\n\nThe estimated value of the damage is about \u00a37,000.\n\n\"This financially has been a major, major blow for myself and my family,\" Mr McDougall told Drivetime after the attack.\n\n\"The monetary [impact] is one thing. But the years of dedication that I've put into my small flock ... it's catastrophic.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to put into words the emotional toll this has taken on my family, especially my two young children.\"\n\nTen of the lambs had to be put down by a vet\n\nMr McDougall said he had experience of dog attacks in the past, but not on this scale.\n\n\"I would have been forced to shoot that dog if I had seen it and had my firearm with me,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is becoming an issue and it needs to be addressed to the general public.\n\n\"Everybody has the right to enjoy our countryside but they must remember that they have responsibilities to wildlife and livestock.\"\n\nA total of 301 incidents of livestock attacks by dogs were recorded by Police Scotland in 2021, with provisional figures suggesting that number dipped to 262 in 2022.\n\nUnder the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2021, dog owners could be fined \u00a340,000 and sent to prison for allowing their pet to attack or worry farmed animals.\n\nScottish Land & Estates (SLE), which represents rural businesses, is one of the partners in a campaign with Police Scotland to warn dog owners and land managers about attacks over lambing season.\n\nSLE policy advisor Simon Ovenden said dog owners and walkers should always keep them on short leads and away from fields where there are lambs, calves or other young animals.\n\n\"Dog walkers should also try to stay as far away from livestock as possible - even aggressive behaviour from a dog such as barking can cause a pregnant sheep to die or miscarry,\" he said.\n\n\"Such incidents are not the dog's fault, but that of the owner, and declaring that a dog has never acted in such a manner previously is of no importance when dealing with the aftermath of an attack.\"\n\nInspector Alan Dron, Police Scotland's national rural crime co-ordinator, added: \"Despite numerous high-profile campaigns over many years, we are still seeing too many incidents of livestock attacks and worrying in our rural areas, often where dogs are being let off the leash or being left unattended and escaping from homes and gardens.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Russia-aligned hackers are seeking to \"disrupt or destroy\" Britain's critical infrastructure, a Cabinet Office minister has warned.\n\nThe groups have started to focus on the UK in recent months, Oliver Dowden said in a speech on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK is not doing enough to protect its infrastructure from cyber threats, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warned.\n\nThe NCSC also issued an official threat alert to critical businesses.\n\nWhile addressing the CyberUK conference in Belfast on Wednesday, Lindy Cameron, the CEO of the NCSC, said the UK needs to have \"resilience to all threats, whether they come from nation states or cyber criminals\".\n\nShe went on to tell the audience: \"If the UK is to be the safest place to live and work online, then resilience must urgently move to the top of our investment shopping list.\"\n\nOfficials are recommending that organisations, such as those behind the UK's energy and water supplies, \"act now\" to protect themselves against the emerging cyber threat.\n\nThe NCSC - which is part of UK cyber and intelligence agency GCHQ - says the hacking groups, which are often sympathetic to Russia's invasion in Ukraine, are ideologically-motivated.\n\nThe alert warned the groups are \"less predictable\" because they \"not subject to formal state control\".\n\n\"Some have stated a desire to achieve a more disruptive and destructive impact against western critical national infrastructure, including in the UK,\" the NCSC said.\n\n\"We expect these groups to look for opportunities to create such an impact, particularly if systems are poorly protected.\"\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Mr Dowden described the hackers as \"Wagner-like\" - a reference to the Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"Disclosing this threat is not something we do lightly,\" he said.\n\n\"But we believe it is necessary if we want these companies to understand the current risk they face, and take action to defend themselves and the country.\"\n\nMr Dowden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, announced plans to set cyber resilience targets for critical sectors to meet within two years and to bring private sector businesses working on critical infrastructure into the scope of resilience regulations.\n\n\"These are the companies in charge of keeping our country running. Of keeping the lights on,\" he said.\n\n\"Our shared prosperity depends on them taking their own security seriously\".\n\nMs Cameron warned it is important the UK's critical national infrastructure is protected from hackers and also to \"make sure people are ready for the threats they could face in the future\".\n\nShe said there have been \"some intent\" in recent months to try to target such UK infrastructure, adding: \"What we are still seeing is quite low-level activity but it is really important that our critical national infrastructure is well protected and resilient.\"\n\nSpeaking on Radio Four's Today programme, she said: \"What we've seen in the last year is really significant cyber activity in Ukraine as a result of Russia's conflict so we want to make sure people are prepared for the consequences of these groups taking an interest in more-widely than Ukraine.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether she has seen attempts to target the UK, she said: \"We're seeing some indication of that, but I wouldn't want to go into further detail.\"Actor Ray Stevenson, pictured at the premiere of Thor: Ragnarok in Los Angeles in 2017\n\nThe actor Ray Stevenson, who appeared in major TV shows

Manchester following representations from his lawyers, who claimed reporting of her death meant he may not receive a fair trial in Liverpool.\n\nNigel Power KC, who represented Cashman at a hearing at Liverpool Crown Court in December, argued the case should move venue.\n\nThomas Cashman was tried in Manchester Crown Court Image caption: Thomas Cashman was tried in Manchester Crown Court\n\nHe referred to comments from former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, the football club's manager Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool City Region's metro-mayor Steve Rotheram and a local priest in the wake of Olivia's killing, as police urged people to come forward with information.\n\nHe said: \"Of course it's good to have a sense of community and pride in your city, we're not saying otherwise, but we say the effect of all this reporting personalises Liverpool, as much as Olivia herself, as the victim.\"\n\nIn her ruling, Mrs Justice Yip said she was not criticising anyone for what was said and done in the aftermath of Olivia's murder, but she said it was likely \"shock and emotion\" had been felt more keenly on Merseyside and the circumstances could lead a fair-minded, informed observer to conclude there was a real risk of one or more of the jury being predisposed to finding guilt in the case.\n\nHe was eventually tried at Manchester Crown Court, and found guilty on all charges this afternoon.Mr Jones Parry, the postmaster, outside his post office at Capel Celyn on 10 December 1956 which was submerged when the valley was flooded\n\nBetsan Powys grew up with the story of how the Welsh-speaking village of Capel Celyn was drowned to provide drinking water for Liverpool.\n\nFrom her decades-long career as a journalist she thought she knew the story. But making a podcast about the drowning and the protests that followed gave her an opportunity to look beyond the passion and the myth.\n\nThe drowning of Capel Celyn is an emotive topic in Wales - the passion some feel almost 60 years on should come as no surprise and has been well documented.\n\nWhen speaking to people whose homes were bulldozed and flooded and hearing the stories of those directly involved in the decades of political protest that followed, what struck me most were the nuances and complexities that came to light.\n\nIt's by listening carefully to these that you get to see beyond the story I thought I knew.\n\nIn my podcast Drowned - The Flooding of a Village, I wanted to explore not just what happened but why it happened from many perspectives, and was keen that the story was told by those who had lived it.\n\nMy aim was to find facts not myths.\n\nA couple at their home in Capel Celyn on 27 February 1957\n\nIn 1965 - the same year as I was born - the nine-year battle to save Capel Celyn was finally lost and the village was flooded.\n\nGrowing up, it was talked about at my school in Cardiff, but I would also have heard the story at home.\n\nMy mother grew up on a farm near the famous graffitied Cofiwch Dryweryn (Remember Tryweryn) wall near Llanrhystud, Ceredigion, and whenever we went to visit my grandparents, we would pass it.\n\nThe graffiti appeared in the 60s and the wall has become a bit of a Welsh landmark, iconic in itself, inspiring similar graffiti works across Wales.\n\nAuthor Meic Stephens painted the Cofiwch Dryweryn mural on the wall of a ruined cottage in the early 1960s\n\nHoodies and other merchandise bearing the words are also worn by some in Wales as a symbol of national pride and defiance.\n\nGrowing up, the conversations around Tryweryn were emotionally charged - and the context of the story was clear, that a Welsh-speaking community had been destroyed at a time when the language was under threat, all protest swept aside by the authorities in Westminster and in Liverpool who would benefit from a new supply of water.\n\nBut it was more than that.\n\nIt was proof of Wales' political impotence, always out-voted and out-muscled by its more powerful neighbour.\n\nIn the summer of 1955, the people of Capel Celyn learnt their homes had been earmarked as the site of a new reservoir to provide water for Liverpool.\n\nThis would mean destroying houses in the village near Bala, Gwynedd, and rehousing the villagers elsewhere.\n\nFor almost a decade after the announcement, the villagers fought to save their homes, with protests and marches through the streets of Liverpool.\n\nSchoolchildren from Capel Celyn protesting against the drowning on 18 December 1956\n\nThe village could not be saved and in 1965 Capel Celyn was flooded, with 75 people having to leave their homes.\n\nIts 12 farms, school, chapel and post office disappeared under water.\n\nBetsan visited the Liverpool Record Office as she researched the history\n\nVisiting the Liverpool Record Office, it struck me that this is Liverpool's story too of course.\n\nBut it is a very different story.\n\nBefore Tryweryn, Liverpool was already getting its water from Wales - but the city's council argued there wasn't enough of it.\n\nThe demand for water in Liverpool had been growing, and as local politicians strove to clear poor housing and improve conditions, they saw a need for a bigger, better water supply.\n\nBuilding the Tryweryn reservoir by drowning Capel Celyn was seen as serving a vital and greater good.\n\nThousands of families in Liverpool would benefit while the handful of people who lived in Capel Celyn would be rehoused.\n\nI spoke to the songwriter and broadcaster Sir Richard Stilgoe, whose father, John Stilgoe, was Liverpool's chief water engineer.\n\nHe designed the Tryweryn reservoir, and Sir Richard remembers spending many Saturdays as a teenager visiting the site.\n\nWhile there, he described seeing a mutual respect growing between his father and the people of the valley.\n\nIt's the fact that Liverpool is in England and Capel Celyn in Wales that turned an honourable attempt to serve \"a greater good\" into \"perceived bullying,\" he believes.\n\n", "s awards. It is unclear whether the government would see these as unaffordable.\n\nKate Bell, assistant general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said any decision to ignore pay review body advice would be \"driven by politics, not economics\".\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that public sector wages had fallen \"well behind inflation\" and that there had been a \"15-year wage squeeze where wages haven't kept up with inflation\".\n\n\"It is a bit rich to hear them [the government] now saying, 'Well, we're going to overturn those independent recommendations' when we haven't even seen them be published yet.\"\n\nThe Telegraph has reported junior doctors in England will be offered an additional \u00a31,000 a year plus a 6% salary increase in a bid to bring an end to upcoming strikes.\n\nOver half a million appointments have been postponed due to strikes by NHS workers over the last six months, according to official figures.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) union, which represents doctors, has been asking for a 35% increase, saying it was to make up for 15 years of below-inflation rises.\n\nThe Treasury has previously suggested pay awards over 5% could fuel inflation. But the BMA claimed the offer was not \"credible\".\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called for the government to resolve the dispute but would not put a figure on how much more doctors should be paid.\n\nHe added that calls from unions for pay restoration could not be delivered \"overnight\".\n\nDoctors represented by the BMA voted to strike between 07:00 on Thursday 13 July and 07:00 on Tuesday 18 July - their longest ever junior doctor strike. The union represents over 46,000 junior doctors in the UK.\n\nJunior doctors make up around half of all hospital doctors in England and a quarter of all doctors working in GP surgeries.\n\nAround 6% of all doctor posts in the NHS are unfilled - for nurses it is nearly twice that level.\n\nMany argue there is still a shortage - with not enough training places or funded doctor posts in the NHS in the first place.\n\nThe government is due to release plans for the \"largest expansion in training and workforce\" in the NHS's history, Mr Sunak announced on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, the prime minister said the plans would reduce \"reliance on foreign-trained healthcare professionals\".The Scotsman worked in renowned restaurants around the world before opening his own in Australia.\n\nHis death was confirmed by broadcaster Network 10 on the day the 2023 season premiere of MasterChef was set to air.\n\nZonfrillo is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and four children, who said in a statement their hearts were \"shattered\".\n\n\"For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky,\" the family said.\n\nZonfrillo was found dead at a house in Melbourne when police conducted a welfare check in the early hours of Monday morning. Victoria Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious.\n\nHis death has sparked an outpouring of grief from figures in the culinary and entertainment world.\n\nCelebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay, as well as a host of former Masterchef contestants led the tributes.\n\nOliver, who had been due to appear in the season opener posted a picture to Instagram of him with Zonfrillo and the two other judges, Melissa Leong and Andy Allen, on set.\n\n\"I'm in total shock to wake up to the sudden death of [Jock].. we had the best time working together for this year's MasterChef,\" he wrote.\n\nRamsay wrote on Twitter: \"Saddened by the devastating news... I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia\".\n\nNetwork 10 also paid tribute to the star, saying Zonfrillo's charisma, passion and wicked sense of humour had inspired a nation of home cooks. MasterChef - which is pre-recorded - will not air this week as planned, it said.\n\nBorn in Glasgow in 1976, Zonfrillo began working in kitchens at 12. At 15, he became one of the youngest-ever apprentices to work at luxury Scottish resort, The Turnberry Hotel.\n\nTwo years later he started working for Michelin-starred British chef Marco Pierre White at his famous Hyde Park Hotel.\n\nBut despite his burgeoning career, Zonfrillo said he became broke, homeless and addicted to heroin in his teenage years. He wrote at length about his struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir, Last Shot.\n\nHe said he turned a new leaf with a move to Australia in 2000, and went on to open several restaurants. His most successful was Adelaide's award-winning Restaurant Orana, which opened in 2013.\n\nIn 2019, the presenter was announced as part of an all new host line-up for MasterChef Australia.\n\nBut Zonfrillo's career was not without controversy. Orana closed in 2020 with debts of millions of dollars, and Last Shot was criticised as inaccurate by former colleagues, including Marco Pierre White.Traffic lights on a street in Kharkiv are working again after Russian missiles targeted the city's power supply\n\nIn central Kharkiv you hear the rattle of generators on every street.\n\nTen days ago, Ukraine's second city was plunged into darkness by a massive, targeted Russian missile attack on the energy system - it was the biggest since the start of the full-scale war.\n\nAs Kharkiv works to restore power, there has been a wave of additional strikes across the country targeting the energy supply.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has condemned what he calls Russia's \"missile terror\".\n\nThe Ukrainian president has also renewed his calls to his country's allies for more air defence systems as protection.\n\nThe authorities in Odesa on the Black Sea in the south of the country say the energy system there was the latest to be hit overnight, with missiles and drones, causing partial blackouts.\n\nIn Kharkiv to the north, the damage is more serious.\n\nKharkiv's mayor, Igor Terekhov, has said it will take weeks to restore full supply and that is if Russia's armed forces don't strike the same targets again.\n\nThe initial attack on the city's energy supply even knocked out the air raid siren. There is now a screeching noise that comes straight to people's mobile phones instead.\n\nThere can be hours of those missile warnings in the city each day - during one on Saturday night, the blast wave from a strike blew out dozens of windows in a block of flats.\n\nBut the Russians have increasingly been aiming at the power grid.\n\n\"The damage is very serious,\" Mr Terekhov told the BBC.\n\n\"We need time to repair it,\" he added, suggesting that meant a couple more months at least.\n\nRussia's defence ministry confirms that its latest strikes have been focused on Ukraine's power supply. It says the aim is to disrupt the work of the country's defence industry and claims that \"all aims of the strike were achieved\".\n\nThe ministry has a long history of disinformation.\n\nBut the Kharkiv mayor did tell the BBC that the city's manufacturing sector, which requires significant power, has been affected by the blackouts. There are no further details.\n\nThe impact on civilian life is more obvious.\n\nBlackout periods have been introduced in order to conserve energy, and there is a schedule for the city. On Saturday those power cuts lasted six hours, but by Sunday they had been reduced to four hours.\n\n\"They were supposed to cut the power to my area at 09:00, so I got up especially early to charge everything,'\" a friend messaged. \"Then I got in the lift and got stuck. They'd cut the power early!\"\n\nA hair salon in a Kharkiv back street is one of many small businesses with a generator whirring noisily outside the door.

This suggested a level of premeditation, he said.\n\n\"It appears that he clearly aimed at the father, that he aimed at his wife, but however he seems less clear as to a possible admission that he aimed at the girl,\" Mr Miansoni said.\n\nSolaine Thornton and her eight-year-old sister Celeste had been playing on a swing as their parents tended the barbecue when the neighbour began firing.\n\nThe younger girl ran to another neighbour's house to raise the alarm and is now said to be in shock.\n\nA local resident told French media that the younger child ran to neighbours shouting: \"My sister is dead, my sister is dead\".\n\nThe victim's parents Adrian and Rachel Thornton were also hurt and are in hospital.\n\nA search of Mr Raats' home uncovered two rifles, one of which had not been previously declared. The couple, both Dutch nationals, tested positive for alcohol and cannabis. They had no previous convictions, prosecutors said.\n\nMr Miansoni said the suspect had expressed regret, and that a mental health assessment had found nothing notable.\n\nFlowers and teddies have been left on the family's front door step\n\nAdrian and Rachel Thornton, both from Oldham, came with their two daughters to live in the hamlet of Saint Herbot in 2019. Theirs is the only English family in the area.\n\nPreviously, the Thorntons had lived in other parts of France. Solaine was born in Brittany and Celeste in the Massif Central in central France.\n\nThe family home in Saint Herbot is a square, whitewashed, relatively modern house with a large plot of land behind and a workhouse which was once a sawmill.\n\nWhile his wife worked in social services and his two children attended local schools, Adrian, a mechanic, spent a lot of time working on his plot of land.\n\nAccording to Marguerite Bleuzen, mayor of the town of Plonevez-du-Faou, the land had been abandoned and was returning to the wild. Adrian set about the task of clearing the land, cutting down undergrowth and some trees.\n\nThis appears to have caused the friction with his neighbours, whose large green-shuttered house looks down onto the Thorntons' plot.\n\n\"I was called out there three years ago, when there were the first tensions,\" said Mr Bleuzen. \"We managed to settle things down, but since then I had never had to intervene.\"\n\nBut after Saturday's shooting, the mayor later heard from neighbours that there had been regular flare-ups.\n\n\"On one occasion, I was told that the Dutch man brought out a weapon. I wish I or the police had been told, and this might have been avoided,\" he said.\n\nLocals say that the English family were well-liked. They lent their plot of land for parking at the hamlet's annual September festival which honours the saint after which it is named. The 14th Century church lies 100m from the Thorntons' house.\n\nBy contrast, no-one seems to have had any contact with Mr Raats or his wife.\n\nAt around 22:00 local time on Saturday night, he fired through his hedge into the plot of land where the Thorntons were having a barbecue.\n\nThe rough-and-ready children's play area, with a swing and a small trampoline, is right next to the hedge which separates the two properties. When the man fired, the girls were at practically point-blank range.\n\nAccording to Mayor Bleuzen, when police arrived, Rachel Thornton was holding her dead child in her arms.\n\nThe UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was providing assistance to a British family.Work pressures are driving thousands of nurses and midwives a year away from the profession, the regulator says.\n\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council said retention was becoming a major concern despite an overall growth in the register.\n\nIts annual report found 27,000 professionals had left the register in the UK in the year to the end of March.\n\nWhile retirement appeared to be the most common reason for leaving, health and exhaustion were cited as the next.\n\nThe regulator said slightly fewer had left than the year before - but the proportion leaving early was still undermining the pipeline of new joiners.\n\nIt surveyed leavers, receiving responses from a third. Most had left the profession earlier than they planned.\n\nNMC Chief Executive Andrea Sutcliffe said: \"There are clear warnings workforce pressures are driving people away.\n\n\"Many are leaving earlier than planned, because of burnout and exhaustion, lack of support from colleagues, concerns about quality of care and workload and staffing levels.\"\n\nThere were, however, a record 52,000 new recruits, including nursing associates - a role, in England only, between healthcare assistants and nurses. Nearly half were recruited from abroad - but the number of those trained domestically rose the most.\n\nIt means there were a record 788,000 professionals on the register at the end of March - 30,000 more than a year previously. This includes those working in the private and social-care sectors, as well as the NHS.\n\nThe register is also becoming more ethnically diverse, the NMC said, with more than a quarter of professionals belonging to ethnic minorities.\n\nAnd as research showed these staff were more likely to face harassment, bullying and abuse, Ms Sutcliffe said, it was important for employers to work harder to foster \"inclusive\" cultures.\n\nThe warning comes amid a pay dispute in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which has led to a series of strikes by Royal College of Nursing members over the past six months.\n\nEngland Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the rise in numbers was \"promising\" and the NHS was on track to hit the government's target of recruiting 50,000 more nurses during this Parliament.\n\n\"We will shortly publish a long-term workforce plan to go even further, including projections for the number of doctors, nurses and other professionals we will need in five, 10 and 15 years' time,\" he added.\n\nBut RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: \"These figures bear out our concerns over the failure to retain experienced staff.", "They say that Mr Guterres has made his opposition to Russia's war very clear.\n\nAnother document, from mid-February, describes a frank conversation between Mr Guterres and his deputy, Amina Mohammed.\n\nIn it, Mr Guterres expresses \"dismay\" at a call from the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Europe to produce more weapons and ammunition as a result of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe two also talk about a recent summit of African leaders. Amina Mohammed says that Kenya's president, William Ruto, is \"ruthless\" and that she \"doesn't trust him.\"\n\nIt is well known that America is among a number of nations which routinely spy on the UN - but when the fruits of that espionage come to light, it is highly embarrassing and, in this case, potentially damaging to Mr Guterres.\n\nThere were few clues as to who leaked the files until Wednesday, when the Washington Post reported it was a gun enthusiast in his 20s who worked on a military base.\n\nIt said he shared the classified information to a small group of men and boys who share a \"love of guns, military gear and God\" on Discord - a social media platform popular with gamers.\n\nThe BBC has been unable to verify the report, which was based on interviews with two members of the chat group.\n\nThe screenshots of the documents themselves, which have since been shared on several Discord discussion channels, have been verified by the BBC.\n\nDiscord said on Wednesday that it was co-operating with law enforcement in its investigation into the leak.\n\n\"This was a series of dangerous leaks,\" US national security spokesperson John Kirby told the BBC.\n\n\"We don't know who's responsible, we don't know why. We are assessing the national security implications, and right now there is also a criminal investigation,\" he said, on Wednesday.\n\n\"We want to get to the bottom of this; we want to find out who did this and why.\"\n\nWashington was \"reaching out actively\" to allies to answer questions they have about the leaks, so they know \"how seriously we are taking this\", he added.\n\nMr Kirby said that while the authenticity of some of the documents had yet to be established, they \"certainly appear to have come from various source of intelligence across the government\".This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I was like, listen, I'm saving for a house so I'm not drinking just now. Which was daft, my mates were, like, why did you turn down a drink from Post Malone?\"\n\nThe rapper, who is known for songs such as Rockstar and Sunflower, said he respected Mr Coleman's decision and instead invited him to sing at his concert's official afterparty.\n\n\"He started saying, how much will you charge? I said nothing, it's Post Malone, this is the chance of a lifetime.\n\n\"He got talking to me and he offered to help me out with my house deposit.\"\n\nMr Coleman described the encounter as \"bizarre\".\n\nThe singer did not reveal how much the star donated, but did say: \"There were things going around saying he'd bought me a house. Obviously this has helped towards me now having a deposit.\"\n\nGregor has been gigging in Glasgow for a decade\n\nPost Malone also passed on his number to the Glaswegian singer, offering to listen to some of his original work.\n\nMr Coleman is now focused on sending his work on to the American, while he \"still remembers having the conversation\".\n\nHe added: \"There's a pressure now that I need to get good songs done, I need to get something happening with it rather than just being, like, I met Post Malone and back to the pub.\n\n\"Hopefully he's still interested and he still wants to hear them and he likes them.

Such a condition would make them inadmissible in most states, but Michigan law allows for handwritten wills as long as they meet other criteria.\n\nTheodore White II - Franklin's third child, from her brief marriage to her former manager - argues that the notarised 11-page document from 2010 is the valid will.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Aretha Franklin: In her own words\n\nThat version lists him as a co-executor or personal representative to the estate, along with Ms Owens, the niece. It also calls for Kecalf and Edward Franklin, the singer's second and fourth sons, to \"take business classes and get a certificate or a degree\" if they wish to benefit from the estate.\n\nMeanwhile, Kecalf and Edward argue that the 2014 version is their mother's primary will.\n\nKecalf replaces his brother as a co-executor in the four-page document. He and his grandchildren would also inherit his mother's $1.2m (\u00a3934,000) gated mansion - a home described by Edward's attorney as \"the crown jewel\".\n\nThe newer document also stipulates that Franklin's gowns either be auctioned or handed over to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington.\n\nClarence Franklin, the eldest child, is not involved in the dispute. He lives", "\"exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before\", while the off-camera responsibilities had added an \"extra level of pressure\".\n\n\"I'm no stranger to hard work,\" he said. \"I've lived by the idea that hard work is good work. Then again, the show did break me.\n\n\"There did come a time where I needed a break and disappeared and went to Mexico for a week and had time on a beach and laid low.\n\n\"I'm now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was. I am excited to see how it turns out. I feel like our hard work wasn't in vain.\"\n\n\"It was a tough time, for sure,\" he added.\n\nIn a separate interview with Entertainment Weekly last month, the Bafta-winner revealed he'd had a \"a bit of a meltdown\" after being unable to switch the character off, and wanted to shake his head just to be rid of him.\n\n\"I was seeing myself in him, but in my personal life,\" he said \"I remember having a bit of a meltdown at home and thinking, like, 'I'm going to shave my head. I need to shave my head because I need to get rid of this character.'\n\n\"And, obviously, we were mid-shooting, so I decided not to\u2026 It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the London-born actor has addressed such concerns.

I told him this.\"\n\nEidevall said he did not feel \"comfortable with the label\".\n\nThe Swede had a brief altercation with Chelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert during the game, which he said arose because the teams had disagreed about whether there should be a multi-ball system when the ball went out.\n\n\"Chelsea wanted a one-ball system,\" said the Arsenal boss. \"So we played with one ball, then in the final minutes they want another ball to play quickly. I said this and Erin was not happy in that situation.\"\n\nEidevall was booked for the incident but Hayes believed he should have been dismissed.\n\nWhen he approached Hayes at full-time, the two initially shook hands, but the Chelsea boss then pushed him away.\n\n\"There is a way to conduct yourself on the touchline,\" she said. \"He got a yellow card and should have been sent off.\n\n\"I get he is a winner, but his behaviour is unacceptable. There were a couple [of instances], but the way he fronted up to Erin was unacceptable. We should not blow it up, and I'm sure when he is calm we can have a conversation.\n\n\"It is not the first time he has been told, but it should not be a massive story.\"\n\nWhen asked about Hayes' comments, Eidevall said he \"did not see it as a big thing\".\n\n\"I don't see me as aggressive. She is irresponsible putting that label on it,\" he added.\n\n\"There is a way you behave in the technical area. You need to be a good winner and a good loser. I am happy with the way I conduct myself. Others need to look at themselves in the mirror.\"\n\nEarlier this season, Manchester City boss Gareth Taylor accused Eidevall of \"bullying\" a fourth official.\n\nThe Arsenal manager responded by saying he was \"disappointed\" by the comments and they were \"borderline slander\".\n\nFormer Chelsea and Arsenal defender Anita Asante, who played under Eidevall at FC Rosengard, said on BBC Two: \"Jonas has got a bit of edge, a bit of intensity and we saw that on the sidelines.\n\n\"He is always there trying to push the players and motivate them.\n\n\"A game like this matters to both managers. It's a part of their personality and character and sometimes it can spill over slightly but it's all in the intention of winning.\"This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Speaking from a relative's home in neighbouring Omdurman, he says he hoped to be helped to escape the conflict which has already claimed hundreds of lives.\n\n\"I had spoken to my MP and had emails advising me to go to the air base,\" he says.\n\nFor almost two weeks, rival factions within the Sudanese military have fought for control, destroying large sections of the capital Khartoum in the process and killing hundreds of civilians.\n\nAfter initially telling people to make their own way out of the country, the British Foreign office eventually put on a series of rescue flights.\n\nBut after 16 hours queuing at the site north of Khartoum, Dr Babiker was told he could not board.\n\n\"They said, 'we are really sorry, this is the guidance from the Home Office'. And a soldier took me out,\" he said.\n\nThere are a large number of people in Sudan with ties to the UK, partially due to historical links between the two countries.\n\nSudan was controlled as a British colony between the 1890s and 1956, when it became independent.\n\nMore than 2,000 British nationals in Sudan have registered with the Foreign Office under evacuation plans.\n\nIn 2020, the Office of National Statistics estimated there were around 35,000 people living in the UK who were born in Sudan, including 20,000 Sudanese nationals.\n\nDr Babiker worked for the NHS through the Covid pandemic\n\nSpeaking on Newsnight, Dr Nadia Baasher of the Sudanese Junior Doctor's Association said Dr Babiker was just one example of a much larger problem. She said she knew of at least 24 NHS doctors in a similar position, having been caught in Sudan while on a short trip there, many of them for the Muslim celebration of Eid.\n\n\"People are heartbroken by the whole situation,\" she said.\n\nShe said that some of those who had gone to the airbase had taken the decision to leave their Sudanese families behind to return to their jobs working in the NHS - and some were travelling with their young children.\n\n\"It's not safe. This is is very disappointing to see that they weren't treated with some consideration.\"\n\nThe operation to rescue British nationals has undoubtedly been a difficult one, with priority given to children, the sick and the elderly.\n\nDowning Street has said eligibility requirements have been set out \"very clearly\" and have not changed, but there is \"an element of discretion\" for those working on the ground in Sudan. The Foreign Office also said other routes were available, \"such as crossing the border into Egypt\".\n\nBut Dr Babiker claims that discretion was not used in his case. He says he would have gladly waited in line, but says he was told to leave the airbase by soldiers.\n\n\"I'd be more than happy to wait for other people to be evacuated before me, but to not have any chance to be evacuated in this very risky situation is.... I'm really feeling disappointed.\"\n\nUK nationals have to make their own way to the Wadi Seidna airstrip unescorted\n\nThe Foreign Office said eight flights had airlifted 897 people from the east African country to Cyprus as of Thursday.\n\nHowever, this is a fraction of the thousands of British nationals thought to be in Sudan and there have been growing reports of situations like Dr Babiker's.\n\nDr Baasher added it would hit future recruitment to an already struggling health service.\n\n\"I think this will have an impact on international medical graduates wanting to join the NHS. They make up about 40% of the workforce and it will make other nationalities think twice about whether they want to work for the NHS.\"\n\nIt comes as a further 72-hour ceasefire has been agreed between", "it's purely for political reasons.

However he hasn't been allowed to interrupt his house arrest to come to court, even though what's at stake is access to his child.\n\nIn the courthouse corridor an activist unfurls a poster.\n\n\"Return Masha to her father!\" it declares. A police officer tells her to take it down.\n\nThe Juvenile Affairs Commission has yet to respond to our request to comment on the case of Alexei Moskalev and his daughter Masha.\n\nOne of Alexei's supporters, Natalya Filatova, believes the story of the Moskalev family reflects the crackdown on dissent in Russia.\n\n\"Our constitution proclaims freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, total freedom for citizens to express their opinions,\" Natalya tells me. \"But now we're forbidden from doing that.\"Laura Young has been collecting vapes on daily dog walks\n\nUp to 2.7 million single-use vapes were littered in Scotland last year, a Scottish government report estimates.\n\nZero Waste Scotland was asked to produce an urgent review because of growing concerns about their environmental impact.\n\nIt offers nine options ranging from a total ban to redesigning disposable vapes so they are easier to recycle.\n\nThe Scottish government has welcomed the report and said it will respond fully in the autumn.\n\nThe study estimates that there are 543,000 users of e-cigarettes in Scotland and predicts that without intervention that will rise to 900,000 by 2027.\n\nIt says 22% of all under-18s - around 78,000 - are believed to have used a vape last year with more young people using them than smoking cigarettes.\n\nTwo-thirds of all users are thought to be aged 25 or under.\n\nOptions being put forward for consideration by ministers include a ban either on all single-use vapes or just flavoured ones which appear more attractive to younger people.\n\nBut it comes with a warning that care must be taken to ensure rechargeable vapes are not used as disposable products, thereby creating even more waste.\n\nThe report warns that a ban may be subject to the Internal Market Act which would require UK government consent.\n\nVaping use among young people has increased\n\nIt also suggests a deposit/return style option where consumers would be reimbursed once the product is brought back to the shop for recycling.\n\nThe review was ordered following a campaign by the environmentalist Laura Young who had been collecting discarded vapes while walking her dog in Dundee.\n\nShe described the report as \"particularly worrying\" but said it offered a comprehensive review of potential actions.\n\nShe added: \"Partial solutions will only get partial results. If we are wanting to completely wipe out the unintended consequences from disposable vapes on public health and the environment, a complete ban must be part of the solution.\"\n\nBatteries in single-use vapes mean they should not be thrown away either in a general waste or recycling bin.\n\nInstead they should be treated as electrical waste which means many users struggle to know what to do with them.\n\nThey are accepted at council recycling facilities and in specialist bins in some shops.\n\nDisposable vapes are the most popular vaping device among teenagers in the UK, surveys suggest\n\nSales revenues through grocery outlets have doubled in just six months, the report concludes.\n\nMore than a quarter of all vapes used are single use, rising to more than half among under-25s.\n\nThe majority of single-use vapes are manufactured in China but the report says incentivising a switch to reusables could increase manufacturing share in Scotland and the UK where there is a larger share in the market for making liquid refills.\n\nThe boss of Edinburgh based vaping firm VPZ has said he is not opposed to a ban on single-use vapes as long as it does not inadvertently create a black market.\n\nDoug Mutter, who is also a director of the UK Vaping Industry Association, welcomed the report and said the Scottish government needed to be more bold by introducing licensing and controls for selling vaping products.\n\nHe said: \"The biggest issue remains - where many imported, unregulated, disposable vaping products are readily available from local convenience stores supermarkets and several other general retailers with no age verification checks or control in place.\n\n\"This is a significant problem that threatens the huge progress of vaping in transforming the health of the nation and helping the country meet its smoke-free targets.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has thanked Zero Waste Scotland for producing the report and said it would respond fully in the autumn.\n\nCircular economy minister Lorna Slater said she had invited ministers from other UK governments to discuss the report's contents and what can be done in response.\n\nShe said: \"This report shows that single use vapes have become a big problem - for our environment, local communities and young people.

They are basically crowns on wheels.\n\nIt means the royal couple will be spared a bumpy ride on the way to the Abbey. Recalling her coronation in 1953, Queen Elizabeth had described the ride in the 18th-Century gold state coach as \"horrible\" and \"not very comfortable\".\n\nOne of her predecessors, William IV, crowned in 1831, described his trip in the carriage as like being on a ship \"in a rough sea\".\n\nThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach is going to be a comfortable ride, says Royal Collection Trust curator Sally Goodsir\n\nBuckingham Palace has not commented on the reason for the switch.\n\nBut even if the Gold State Coach has its drawbacks, it is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship, with elaborate carvings under a thin layer of gold and panels covered in paintings. It may be uncomfortable but it is a rolling work of art.\n\nHelping the four-tonne carriage to make the journey will be Martin Oates, who will be the carriage's brakeman on coronation day.\n\nHe follows his great-grandfather who took part in the carriage procession for the coronation of George VI, his grandfather who was there for the coronation of Elizabeth II and his father for the late Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977.\n\n\"When you're walking down The Mall, you do think of all the family members who have been part of it,\" said Mr Oates, speaking at the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace, where the carriages are kept.\n\nMartin Oates's family have worked on coronations for four generations\n\nHead coachman Matthew Power said the \"hairs go up on the back of your neck\" on such an occasion, but it was important to stay calm and to stop the horses from getting nervous.\n\n\"The horses know it's going to be a big day and you have to be the calm one and say it's just another day at the office,\" said Mr Power.\n\nThe coronation ceremony will use the traditional regalia, such as symbolic rings and swords, as well as the crowns, including the St Edward's crown which will be placed on the King's head.\n\nThe sceptres being used will include one from the 17th Century made from ivory, after speculation that it might be withdrawn because of animal conservation concerns.\n\nThe oldest item being used will be a spoon to hold the oil for the anointing in the coronation. This spoon, possibly 12th Century, is a rare surviving part of the original medieval coronation regalia, most of which was destroyed after the English Civil War in the 17th Century.\n\nAmong more than 2,000 guests expected to be in the Abbey will be 450 representatives of charity and community groups, who will be alongside world leaders, politicians and royalty.\n\nThere have been complaints about the cost of the coronation from anti-monarchy campaigners. In terms of the public expenditure, the government will not publish a figure until after the event.\n\nThis spoon is the oldest surviving piece of the original medieval coronation regalia\n\nTracy Borman, royal historian and author, said: \"This is going to feel quite modern as far as a coronation goes.\n\n\"We've already heard about the anointing oil which the palace was at pains to say was vegan, there will be as quarter as many guests [as Elizabeth II's] when a staggering 8,000 plus people were crammed into Westminster Abbey, and it's also the first time in 300 years the Queen Consort has been crowned with an existing crown rather than having a new one made for them.\"\n\nWhen the procession comes back to Buckingham Palace, the newly-crowned Charles and Camilla will appear on the balcony, alongside other senior members of the Royal Family.\n\nLast year, for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee, only working royals were allowed on the balcony, excluding those such as Prince Harry and Prince Andrew who had stepped down from royal duties.\n\nAnd proving this is a 21st Century coronation, a special emoji has been created for the occasion.\n\nRead the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan - sign up here.\n\nRead the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan - sign up here.An evacuation order is in place in Osoyoos, British Columbia\n\nA third firefighter has died in Canada while battling the country's worst wildfire season on record.\n\nAuthorities say the firefighter died tackling the Donnie Creek fire near Fort St John, in the western province of British Columbia.\n\nPeople are evacuating an area further south in the province, near the US border, as fires swirl out of control.\n\nA third of all fires currently raging in Canada are in British Columbia.\n\nSo far this season, Canadian wildfires have burned about 30 million acres of land - more than the land area of South Korea or Cuba.\n\nResidents in the town of Osoyoos, in the south of the province, and its surrounding areas were told to evacuate late on Saturday after a fire originating from the northwestern US state of Washington crossed into Canada.\n\nPeople in the town shared photos of the approaching fire on social media, including the image above.\n\nTwo other firefighters have died in separate incidents this month in what has become Canada's worst wildfire season on record.\n\nA fourth person, the pilot of a helicopter helping with \"bucketing\" operations, died after a crash in the neighbouring Alberta province last week.\n\nSome 613 of the 990 fires currently active in Canada are considered out of control.\n\nBritish Columbia's premier David Eby confirmed the third firefighter's death in a statement on Saturday, saying: \"My heart goes out to the family, friends and colleagues of this frontline hero.\"\n\nMr Eby said the season this year had been \"profoundly awful\" and described firefighters making \"extraordinary sacrifices... to keep us safe\".\n\nIn June, firefighters in Nova Scotia on the Atlantic coast battled the province's largest ever wildfire.\n\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nCanada is estimated to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and its extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense.\n\nIts wildfires have also sparked pollution alerts across North America, as smoke is blown south along the continent's eastern coast.

He was released last week with a verbal reprimand.\n\nA separate recent case also raised human rights concerns over the Queensland's youth justice system, which is currently undergoing reform.\n\nIn February, it emerged that another 13-year-old Queensland boy with developmental disabilities spent 78 days confined to a cell for 20 hours per day.\n\nQueensland is currently debating new laws which would criminalise bail breaches by minors - a change which will cause the youth prison population to increase dramatically, experts warn.\n\nState Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said the recent cases may have breached Queensland's Human Rights Act, which states all prisoners should have access to fresh air and exercise for a minimum of two hours a day.\n\nHe warned that changes to the law would only make the situation worse, and that immediate steps were needed to stop children being placed in isolation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I don't think they're isolated cases,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"Given the laws that are [being] passed in Queensland, which are clearly intended to incarcerate more children, it becomes even more important that the government urgently develops a coherent plan for preventing children coming within the criminal justice system, \" he said.\n\n\"My concern is by increasing the pressure on the system, we risk normalising the mistreatment of children\".\n\nMr McDougall urged the state government to \"double down\" on measures to keep children in school and stop them going down \"the path of criminalisation\".\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were 12 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous Australians in 2021, the Queensland Statisticians Office says.\n\nRates of juvenile incarceration are also high, with Indigenous children accounting for some 70% of detainees across most of Queensland, and over 90% in the state's north.\n\nOvercrowded facilities mean children and minors often have to be housed in adult prisons known as watch houses. Most juvenile detainees are being held on remand.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs said solitary confinement or \"separations\" were only used as a last resort.\n\nYouth detention centres were \"complex and difficult environments, and practices used in the centres are designed to ensure the safety of staff and young people at all times,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities.\"Lesley Manville will narrate a new translation of Sn\u00f6frid\n\nAward-winning actress Lesley Manville will help to launch the 2023 Proms season on Friday night, narrating a new translation of Jean Sibelius's Sn\u00f6frid.\n\nThe star, who plays Princess Margaret in The Crown, will be making her Proms debut alongside the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe opening night will also feature a new work by Ukrainian composer Bohdana Frolyak, called Let The Light In.\n\nAnd the BBC Singers will perform, just months after being saved from closure.\n\nTime was called on the UK's only full-time professional chamber earlier this year as a result of BBC budget cuts.\n\nHowever, the 20-member group were given hope in March after \"a number of organisations\" came forward to offer alternative funding.\n\nThey will now appear at five concerts throughout the eight-week Proms season.\n\nConcerts will take place across the UK, from Cornwall to Perth and Derry to Aberystwyth, although the festival's headquarters remain at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nEager Prommers were already queuing outside the venue at 08:00 BST on Friday morning, hoping to get one of the 1,000 on-the-day tickets that are available for every show, for just \u00a38.\n\n\"The point with the Proms is it is the most accessible of all arts festivals,\" says BBC Radio 3's Petroc Trelawney, who is hosting many of this year's concerts.\n\n\"What senior football match can you go to for eight pounds?

Ms Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh, believes the anti-hate crime law that has come into force in Scotland is a threat to free speech. She has said she looks forward to being arrested, if what she has written about some trans people - who are protected under the new legislation - qualifies as an offence. Both the Mail and the Telegraph highlight support from Rishi Sunak for the author's \"defiance\". The prime minister is quoted saying: \"People should not be criminalised for stating simple facts on biology. We believe in free speech in this country, and Conservatives will always protect it\".\n\nThe Guardian has conducted analysis which suggests that the government has made \"zero progress\" on half of the Conservatives' levelling up goals. The study indicates that of the 12 initial targets set for less prosperous regions of Britain, nothing has been achieved in education, skills, wellbeing, local pride, housing and health. An academic is quoted accusing ministers of \"failing to turn the tide on regional inequalities\". But the levelling up department denies failure, saying the plan is \"long-term\" and it is making \"", "in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2012.

And there is no barrier to competing more than once in this contest.\n\nBackstage after the show in her dressing room I cheekily asked if they were true? \"Darling,\" was all she said.\n\nA few weeks later it was confirmed Loreen would be participating in Melodifestivalen - the TV selection show to pick Sweden's participant for the song contest in Stockholm.\n\nIt runs for six weeks and has become a must-watch event for Eurovision fans around the world - with viewing parties in different cities.\n\nThe crowd at Melodifestivalen is packed to the arena rafters in Stockholm\n\nAfter one such party at the Swedish church in north London in early March, fans piled into the upstairs of a pub around the corner and Eurovision hits were played.\n\nTattoo, Loreen's Melodifestivalen entry came on, and people put down drinks to dance to it hard. Bear in mind, it hadn't even won the Swedish selection by then.\n\nBut she is royalty in Eurovision world and fans were excited that she was trying again.\n\nWhen the final rolled around on 11 March in Stockholm, and the BBC's Eurovisioncast went to interview her, she picked up the conversation again with: \"Darling...\".\n\n\"I didn't think I'd do it ever again,\" she said. \"But then they sent me the song and I could just feel it was a good song, and then they popped the question.\n\nIt took her team, which included the same songwriter and producers of Euphoria, around four weeks to change her mind and convince her to go for the double gold in Liverpool.\n\nSweden and Finland picked their acts on the same night - the last two countries to confirm their participants in this year's contest.\n\nNow Loreen was in the mix, the other contestants were excited.\n\nThe UK's Mae Muller continuously refers to her as a \"queen\", while other Eurovision artists openly said that she had it in the bag.\n\nMeanwhile, Tattoo continued to notch up tens of millions of streams.\n\nPre-party events took place across Europe in the run-up to Liverpool and fans travelled to places like Madrid and London to see her perform her two Eurovision songs live.\n\nOutside the venue in London, many fans had Swedish flags and said they were there specifically for Loreen.\n\nIt's hard to encapsulate her cultural significance in the competition's history but she generated a whole new generation of fans of the song contest after 2012 - including myself.\n\n\"I love this community,\" Loreen said, as she posed for selfies. \"I hope people feel how much I love them and care\".\n\nOnce rehearsals began in Liverpool and a full arena of 6,000 people packed into the venue for preview shows this week, it was fascinating to hear the crowd's silence when she sang.\n\nThe audience was transfixed by her and nobody wanted to miss a moment.\n\nShe created a performance that looked visually stunning on-screen, captivating the 160 million watching at home with pyrotechnics, smoke machines, incredible staging and, most-importantly, stand-out vocals.\n\nSweden's 2023 win puts it on par with Ireland as having the most victories in the competition with seven.\n\nNext year, the competition will head to Scandinavia -

for poliovirus, which was declared in May 2014.\n\nDr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"If you're eligible and still need to take up the vaccine, please come forward ahead of the summer months to ensure you have maximum protection.\n\n\"First doses of the vaccine will end on 16 June and both doses will cease at the end of July.\"\n\u2022 None What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.At the start of the day the question on the lips of those following Starship's planned test launch was whether lift off would even happen. On Monday, a first launch of SpaceX's rocket - the most powerful ever built - was halted because of a frozen valve. So when Starship's launch on Thursday was paused moments before blast-off, it felt like deja-vu.\n\nThen there was lift-off. Starship blasted off into the Texas sky, but minutes into its flight it exploded after its booster failed to separate.\n\nDespite the explosion, SpaceX will still see the launch as a success that can be built on, as our science correspondent Jonathan Amos notes.

The absence of such official approval can mean missing out on promotions or even not getting a government job in the first place.\n\nBut Prof Yang says she thinks that, as society becomes more tolerant towards unmarried mothers, such discrimination will gradually disappear.\n\nIf the national government, in the future, requires local officials to more strictly enforce regulations allowing single women to become parents this might also help, she says.\n\nAs for Zhang Meili, she says this should be a choice for the women themselves.\n\nI ask her what advice she would give others who find themselves in the same situation as her and she replies: \"It depends on their personal situation but, if they love kids, they should have them.\n\n\"Don't lose a child because of other people's voices or because of questions coming at you from the outside.\"Assistant Chief Constable Thom McLoughlin with (left) Hull City's Julia Weldon and East Riding of Yorkshire Council's Angela Dearing\n\nPolice say it is not possible to identify any of the cremated ashes at the centre of a major probe into a Hull funeral directors.\n\nHumberside Police began investigating Legacy Independent Funeral Directors on 6 March following \"concern for care of the deceased\".\n\nThirty-five bodies and a quantity of ashes were recovered from the firm.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Thom McLoughlin said the latest development would be \"devastating\" for families.\n\nMr McLoughlin told a press conference on Thursday that the force had updated more than 700 affected families over the Easter weekend.\n\nRobert Bush, who runs Legacy Independent Funeral Directors, pictured with daughter and employee Saskya Bush\n\nHe said officers had been working closely with forensic scientists \"to assess whether it was possible to extract DNA from the human ashes in order to identify them\".\n\nWhile the force was satisfied the \"proper cremation process had been followed\", Mr McLoughlin said experts had deduced it would not be possible \"to recover a meaningful DNA profile\".\n\nHe added: \"This will, of course, be devastating news for families and loved ones.\"\n\nMr McLoughlin said extensive work was continuing to formally identify the 35 bodies recovered from the firm's Hessle Road site.\n\nIt was a lengthy process but he added that - once completed - it would \"provide families with complete assurances as to the identity of their loved ones\" and \"repatriation with their families\".\n\nMr McLoughlin said investigators were also following up calls relating to suspected financial fraud.\n\nPolice received a report of \"concern for the care of the deceased\" at Legacy Independent Funeral Directors on 6 March\n\nAddressing those who might have taken out funeral plans with Legacy Independent Funeral Directors, he said: \"Please contact and speak to your insurance provider in the first instance and establish if the policy is legitimate or not.

Shares saw their biggest one-day drop on record on Thursday, plunging more than 60% and fell further in after-hours sales before trading was halted.\n\nConcerns that other banks could face similar problems led to widespread selling of bank shares globally on Thursday and early Friday.\n\nSpeaking in Washington on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was monitoring \"recent developments\" at Silicon Valley Bank and others \"very", "s lawyers more \"latitude to cross-examine [Ms Carroll] and her witnesses\".\n\nMs Carroll, 79, says the attack occurred at a Bergdorf Goodman store in late 1995 or early 1996.\n\nShe says she and Mr Trump bumped into each other while shopping and alleges he later assaulted her in one of the store's changing rooms.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Tacopina questioned why Ms Carroll continued to return to the Bergdorf Goodman store several times after the alleged assault.\n\n\"Bergdorf's is not a place I'm afraid to enter,\" she said.\n\nMr Trump, who is running in the 2024 presidential election, has repeatedly denied Ms Carroll's allegations.\n\nA former columnist for Elle magazine, Ms Carroll was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\n\nThe act allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state over claims that would have normally exceeded statute limitations.Keely Morgan's parents said their daughter was \"sensible, kind and not one person ever had a bad word to say about her\"\n\nA teenager was hit and killed by a car on a zebra crossing as she made her way home, an inquest opening has heard.\n\nKeely Morgan, 15, spent Bank Holiday Monday with her family at the seaside in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and went for a walk after they got home.\n\nShe was hit as she crossed Heol Trelai in Caerau, Cardiff, at about 21:30 BST on 1 May and died at the scene.\n\nA post-mortem examination concluded that she died as a result of \"multiple blunt force injuries\".\n\nCoroner Graeme Hughes said he had reason to suspect the death was \"unnatural or violent\"and that an inquest was needed.\n\nA 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThe hearing was adjourned while police continue their investigations into what happened ahead of another hearing in four months.\n\nIn a tribute released previously, Keely's parents said she had a \"beautiful smile\" that lit up the room, while her teachers described her as an \"exceptional student\" who loved school.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWomen in Afghanistan have held a rare protest against the Taliban's decision to shut female beauty parlours and salons.\n\nWomen shouted \"work, bread and justice\" while they were gathered in the capital city, Kabul.\n\nTaliban guards responded with water cannons, and some protesters said stun guns were also used against them.\n\nWomen's rights have been increasingly restricted since Taliban rulers returned to power in 2021.\n\nAround 50 women took part in the protest on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency.\n\nThe Taliban have given businesses one month from 2 July to close thousands of beauty salons across the country.\n\nThey said the wearing of wigs and the practice of eyebrow-plucking were against Islamic values and parents were wasting money on beauty parlours when couples get married.\n\nThe decision further restricts the spaces accessible to Afghan women, who are already barred from classrooms, gyms and parks. More recently, the Taliban also banned them from working for the United Nations.\n\nThe closure of all beauty salons will lead to the loss of 60,000 jobs, Afghanistan's chamber of commerce said.\n\nBeauty salons were last shut when the Taliban ruled between 1996 and 2001. They stayed open after the Taliban retook power two years ago following the withdrawal of US forces, but shop windows were often covered up and images of women outside salons were spray painted to hide their faces.\n\nThe Taliban's restrictions on women, which include strict dress codes and limits to them travelling alone, have continued despite international condemnation.\n\nThere have been minor sporadic protests against measures introduced by the Taliban, but any form of dissent is being crushed.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Women in Afghanistan face an uncertain future following the Taliban's takeoverShazia Saddiq and Sue Palmer said the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives\n\n\"I lost absolutely everything. It has been absolutely horrendous.\"\n\nShazia Saddiq is one of many former Post Office branch managers wrongly accused of crimes due to accounting errors caused by a faulty IT system.\n\nAlong with Sue Palmer, who told the BBC the allegations \"ruined my life\", the pair are still waiting for full compensation several years on.\n\nA report on Monday called for action and law changes to stop issues \"blocking full and fair compensation\".\n\nThe head of an inquiry into the Post Office scandal, Sir Wyn Williams, said schemes set up to compensate sub-postmasters and sub-postmistress wrongly accused of crimes were a \"patchwork quilt with some holes in it\".\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, more than 700 Post Office branch managers were given criminal convictions when faulty accounting software, called Horizon, made it look as though money was missing from their sites.\n\nThe cases constitute Britain's most widespread miscarriage of justice. Some people went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. Some victims have since died.\n\nThere has been a public inquiry, led by Sir Wyn, which has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters, and to establish who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them.\n\nSir Wyn said on Monday that his criticisms over delays in compensation \"remain justified\".\n\nMs Saddiq, 39, along with fellow former sub-postmistress Mrs Palmer told the BBC the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives.\n\nMs Saddiq, who used to run three Post Offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, said she had \"lost everything\" as a result of being accused of crimes a decade ago, including her home above one branch.\n\nShe did not end up facing criminal prosecution, but she had to leave the area with her two young children after being assaulted with flour in the street.\n\n\"I had to flee, me and my children overnight. They left their friends behind, they had to change schools,\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, who was found not guilty after a trial, said the allegations had \"ruined my life\".\n\n\"I was made homeless, I now live in a one-bedroom studio flat (because of the financial impact),\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, from Essex, had previously told the BBC she received a compensation payment in December, but soon realised it was not what it seemed, with a significant chunk of the money going straight to pay her creditors. She is now seeking proper compensation for the scandal.\n\nThe former postmistresses welcomed the latest report by Sir Wyn, but both called for the compensation process to be sped up.\n\n\"To keep a human being in this fight mode for such a long time, it's torturous. I want to be free from this now,\" Ms Saddiq said.\n\nMrs Palmer added: \"Words are no good now, we need actions. We need the Post Office to have accountability and the government.\"\n\nSub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions\n\nIn the report laid before Parliament, Sir Wyn said there was no \"valid legal reason\" why the government and Post Office \"cannot give effect to the commitments they which they have made\" in providing \"full and fair\" compensation.\n\nThe retired judge said it was his job to make sure ministers and Post Office executives \"made good on those promises\" made to provide compensation to legitimate claimants \"promptly\" and to make sure the amounts paid out was \"recognised to be full and fair\".\n\nSir Wyn has long held concerns about the slow progress of compensation for Post Office staff.\n\nBut the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, told the BBC's World At One programme that the \"sheer scale\" of the miscarriage of justice had \"gone above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect\".\n\n\"It", "committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie,\" he claims.\n\nOne former cabinet minister I was talking to said - hoped - that \"ex MPs become very ex very quickly\".\n\nThey added, from reading the Tory MP WhatsApp groups and public statements in recent days, that Boris Johnson has only a shrivelled rump of parliamentary support.\n\nBut others will wonder if this report - as punishingly brutal as it is - may motivate a martyrdom, may rally support.\n\n\"Spiteful, vindictive and overreaching\" is the verdict of one Boris Johnson supporter on the Tory backbenches, Brendan Clarke-Smith.\n\nOne minister said to me: \"Boris is the sort of bloke who could fall down a manhole head first and still land on his feet.\"\n\nBut this is one heck of a manhole.Chris Packham sued three men for libel at the High Court\n\nNaturalist Chris Packham has won his libel claim against a website that alleged he misled people into donating to a tiger rescue charity.\n\nThe presenter sued in the High Court over articles published on the Country Squire Magazine website.\n\nMr Justice Saini ruled in Mr Packham's favour against Mr Wightman and Mr Bean, but dismissed the one against Mr Read.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Mr Packham said online abuse and hate crimes were a \"vile part of modern life\".\n\nHe said it \"ruins lives, livelihoods, reputations, it disrupts young peoples' educations, causes incalculable mental health problems and tragically causes people to take their own lives\".\n\n\"As it stands the criminal law is simply not there to protect us from such hate - something that must change.\"\n\nThe Isle of Wight sanctuary is a home for rescued tigers, the court heard\n\nHe thanked his followers for their \"unswerving support and belief in my honest crusade to make the world a better place for wildlife, people and the environment\".\n\nMr Wightman and Mr Bean were ordered to pay \u00a390,000 in damages to the Springwatch host.\n\n\"Mr Packham did not commit any acts of fraud or dishonesty,\" the judge said in his 58-page judgment.\n\n\"Mr Packham did not lie and each of his own statements was made with a genuine belief in its truth.\n\n\"There was no fraud of any type committed by him in making the fundraising statements.\"\n\nDuring the trial Mr Packham said he had been targeted because of his \"deeply held views\" about blood sports.\n\nThe 61-year-old and his partner Charlotte Corney are trustees of Isle of Wight sanctuary the Wildheart Trust.\n\nChris Packham was photographed with his partner Charlotte Corney outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the case\n\nMr Packham was accused of dishonestly raising money at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic while knowing the charity was due to receive a \u00a3500,000 benefit from its insurance.\n\nBut Mr Justice Saini said Mr Wightman and Mr Bean did not \"come even close to establishing the substantial truth\".\n\n\"Rather than approaching the task with an investigative mind, these defendants targeted Mr Packham as a person against whom they had an agenda,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"Any investigative journalism quickly gave way\u2026 to increasingly hyperbolic and vitriolic smearing of Mr Packham, with further unsubstantiated allegations of dishonesty regarding peat-burning and the trust's insurance gratuitously thrown in.\"\n\nChris Packham (pictured with his fellow Springwatch presenters) says he was targeted because of his \"deeply held views\" about blood sports\n\nGiving evidence during the trial, Mr Packham explained: \"We weren't hopeful that we would be insured against Covid-19 closures.\"\n\nHe said the insurance payments \"ultimately saved the sanctuary in what was a time of dire need\".\n\n\"But to be very clear, if we had not launched the fundraising appeal as rapidly as we did then these payments may have arrived too late to make a difference,\" he said.\n\nHe said the defendants' claims had \"misled, agitated and fuelled a vocal and violent conspiratorial fringe who increasingly post threatening and vile material about me and my family\".\n\nMr Packham denied all the accusations levelled against him by Country Squire Magazine's editor\n\nMr Packham added: \"I do go to walk my dogs in the woods and wonder 'is today the day that a psychopath fuelled by all this hate turns up and kills me?'\n\n\"I genuinely no longer expect to live a long life free from violence and intimidation, because it may only take the one wrong person to read Country Squire Magazine for things to go horribly wrong.\"\n\nDuring the trial Mr Wightman and Mr Bean's lawyer said the articles were true and in the public interest.\n\nMr Read's lawyer described him as a \"mere proof reader\" and not responsible for the articles.\n\nThe judge agreed that Mr Read \"had no editorial or equivalent responsibility for the statements complained of or the decision to publish them\".\n\nBut he said the others had \"used this litigation as a device to introduce offensive material to smear Mr Packham\".\n\nHe added: \"The tone descended into sinister threats and outright vitriol, including offensive references to Mr Packham's neurodiversity, and abuse of (solicitors) Leigh Day.\n\n\"These were not the product of any acts of responsible journalism.\"\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Ocean was obscured behind a screen for much of the performance, and the middle of the set featured a DJ playing remixes of Ocean's songs, including Slide, Provider and Lost.\n\n\"Ocean looks like he's struggling up there,\" wrote the LA Times in a live blog of the show. \"Nothing has achieved lift-off on a real groove yet and the crowd is looking puzzled. This is sedate to the point of confusion.\"\n\nA planned livestream of the show was also scrapped and, because Ocean arrived on stage almost an hour late, the concert ended abruptly when he overshot the festival's midnight curfew.\n\nDespite the setbacks, there were some highlights, including a reworked version of White Ferrari and an ethereal performance of Godspeed.\n\nOcean dedicated the show to his brother Ryan, who died in a car accident three years ago at the age of 20.\n\n\"These last couple years, my life changed so much,\" he told the audience. \"My brother and I, we came to this festival a lot. I feel like I was dragged out here half the time because I hated the dust... but I would always wind up here.\n\n\"I know he would have been so excited to be here with all of us, and I want to say thank you for the support and the ears and the love over all this time.\"\n\nAfterwards, reports emerged of drastic last-minute changes to the show, which was originally due to involve 120 ice skaters.\n\nDetails emerged in hockey podcast Empty Netters, whose hosts Dan and Chris Powers were among the professional skaters who had been due to perform.\n\n\"For about a month, we've been doing rehearsal, we've been hanging with Frank, hanging with the other skaters, hanging with these incredible figure skaters, going through this whole process - this huge ordeal,\" Dan told listeners.\n\nBut when they got to the festival site in the Colorado Desert, they were told Ocean had injured his ankle and the ice was being melted.\n\n\"So now we're being told that we're still going to put on these sequined Prada suits, but we're just going to walk back-and-forth on stage for about five minutes, we're not gonna skate,\" Dan continued.\n\n\"And Chris and I, straight up, with Frank Ocean right there... we just go, 'No, dude. No thank you.'\"\n\nHowever, the duo were full of praise for the singer, despite the problems.\n\n\"He had a very clear vision, and even though that vision changed a lot, he was always on us, helping us, making sure everyone hit what he was picturing in his mind,\" said Chris.\n\n\"He was cool with everyone, he was teaching everyone how to sing the songs, giving them the cadence,\" Dan added.\n\n\"It felt like this was thing he really cared about, that he was super psyched about, and to see it all fall apart was definitely sad... but also nuts.\"\n\nIn a statement confirming his cancellation, Ocean reflected on the opening weekend.\n\n\"It was chaotic.

That is another fight.\n\n\"But today we won. Today the message has gone out: No more coal in Wales.\"\n\nMs Austin's husband Chris said he was \"over the moon\" but the 67-year-old is now concerned about the future of the site, which he called \"a scar on the mountain side\".\n\nThe retired software worker was worried about the cost of repairing the land, estimated at \u00a375m-\u00a3125m, and feared the company would \"walk away\".\n\nHe said: \"That cost would bankrupt this authority.\"\n\nPhilip Hughes says coal has no place in Wales' future\n\nRetired retailer Philip Hughes, 59, of Carmarthen, said: \"It's excellent news. Coal mining has got to stop.\n\n\"Climate change is such a massive issue for the planet. [The mine] has to close as soon as possible and action should be taken to close it.\"\n\nFriends of the Earth Cymru director Haf Elgar said she felt a \"big sense of relief\".\n\nShe added: \"This sets a strong precedent about any more coal coming from Wales.\"\n\nCoal Action Network campaigner Anne Harris, 38, travelled from Lancaster to be at the meeting.\n\nShe compared standing at the bottom of Ffos y Ffran to \"standing in the belly of a slaughtered beast\".\n\nShe said she was unsurprised by the apparent gap in the restoration fund, but was \"ecstatic\" with the result of the meeting, saying: \"This community has suffered for too long.\"\n\nProtests held in this long-running saga even attracted the support of the United Nations' top legal expert on the human rights of communities affected by pollution in 2017.\n\nThe mine itself always rejected the claims, arguing that it was heavily regulated and provides well-paid jobs in an area that badly needed them.\n\nAfter 15 years, planning permission ran out in September 2022 - but the company in charge applied for an extension.\n\nMerthyr (South Wales) Ltd wanted to be allowed to keep coal mining until the end of March 2024 and push back the date for final restoration of the site to June 2026.\n\nWelsh government coal policy prevents the development of new mines or extensions to existing ones apart from in \"wholly exceptional circumstances\".\n\nAn aerial view of Ffos-y-Fran opencast coal mine in November 2021\n\nThe company argued it qualified, claiming to have a role of \"national importance\" in supplying the Port Talbot steelworks.\n\nBut it also admitted that \"insufficient funds\" had been set aside to complete the restoration of the land as envisaged back in 2005, and time was needed to put forward and consult on a revised plan.\n\nPlanning consultant Huw Towns told the hearing \"there is a very real risk that one of the substantial benefits of the scheme will not be delivered\".\n\nCouncillor after councillor made speeches saying they rejected the proposals, to applause and cheers from the packed public gallery.\n\nCouncillor Declan Salmon said residents were left \"with more questions than answers - what a mess this has been from the very beginning\".\n\nThese arguments", "Staff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that violation \"needlessly raises tensions\" in the region.\n\nHe added that the launch shows that North Korea's government \"prioritises weapons\" over the \"well-being of its people\".\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol also convened an emergency meeting of his national security council from Lithuania. where he is attending the Nato summit.\n\nNorth Korea's last launch was in mid-June when it fired two short-range ballistic miles in response to US and South Korean drills. It last test-fired an ICBM in February.\n\nICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range, including mainland United States.\n\nWhen Pyongyang tested one in November 2022, it fired it at a high-angle, short-range trajectory. But this could have reached the US mainland if it were fired at a lower trajectory, the Japanese government said at the time.\n\nWednesday's launch comes days after heated rhetoric from Pyongyang warning the US to stop its air patrols and proposal for a nuclear submarine to visit Korean waters.\n\nOn Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong, accused a US surveillance plane of violating North Korea's air space. She said if such flights continued, there would be \"shocking\" consequences.\n\nSuch rhetoric falls into Pyongyang's pattern of \"inflating external threats to rally domestic support and justify weapons tests\", said Prof Leif-Eric Easley, a North Korea expert at Ewha University in Seoul.\n\nHe added Pyongyang often timed launches to \"disrupt what it perceives as diplomatic coordination against it\", referring to the Nato summit where South Korea and Japan leaders were due to meet on the sidelines.\n\nDespite UN sanctions, Kim Jong-Un has repeatedly vowed to increase his country's production of nuclear warheads and development of more powerful weapons.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the latest North Korean hardware to be on display in late July when the country celebrates the anniversary of the Korean War armistice, known in the country as Victory Day.Ex-US President Donald Trump is suing his former lawyer for $500m (\u00a3400m), alleging breach of contract.\n\nHe says Michael Cohen breached his duty as attorney to act in his client's best interests.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid escalating attacks from Trump allies on Mr Cohen, who is a key witness in a New York investigation into the ex-president.\n\nA Manhattan prosecutor last week charged Mr Trump with fraud in relation to hush-money payments to a porn star.\n\nMr Cohen's spokesman and lawyer, Lanny Davis, told the BBC he was confident the lawsuit against his client would fail.\n\nThe legal action, filed in a Florida federal court, also accuses Mr Cohen of making \"improper, self-serving, and malicious statements about his former client, his family members, and his business\".\n\nMr Cohen worked as Mr Trump's attorney for more than a decade. He was also a vice-president at the Trump Organization and was often described as Mr Trump's fixer.\n\nBut the two had a significant falling out after the 2016 election, as investigators began looking into several of Mr Trump's aides.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison and a fine, after pleading guilty to charges of fraud and campaign finance violations.\n\nNow out of prison, Mr Cohen has become a high-profile critic of Mr Trump and a frequent guest on news programmes.\n\nHe has written a book and hosts a podcast, both of which Mr Trump cites in the lawsuit, which claims Mr Cohen fabricated conversations and wrongfully called Mr Trump a \"racist\" in his 2020 book Disloyal.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Mr Davis said: \"Mr Trump appears once again to be using and abusing the judicial system as a form of harassment and intimidation against Michael Cohen.\n\n\"It appears he is terrified by his looming legal perils and is attempting to send a message to other potential witnesses who are co-operating with prosecutors against him.\"\n\nNew York prosecutors have charged Mr Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in what they say was an effort to cover up payments intended to keep former porn star Stormy Daniels, quiet about her alleged affair with the ex-president.\n\nOn 4 April, Mr Trump appeared in Manhattan criminal court - the first former US president ever indicted on criminal charges. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nMr Cohen has admitted, while acting as Trump's fixer, he facilitated a $130,000 (\u00a3104,000) pay-out to Ms Daniels.\n\nAs Mr Trump's court date approached, Mr Cohen made numerous appearances on major network news programmes and criticised his former boss.\n\n\"He's not thick-skinned,\" Cohen told CNN, speaking after Mr Trump's indictment. \"He's actually very thin-skinned, and he has a very fragile ego.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Then again, the show did break me.\n\n\"There did come a time where I needed a break and disappeared and went to Mexico for a week and had time on a beach and laid low.\n\n\"I'm now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was. I am excited to see how it turns out. I feel like our hard work wasn't in vain.\"\n\n\"It was a tough time, for sure,\" he added.\n\nIn a separate interview with Entertainment Weekly last month, the Bafta-winner revealed he'd had a \"a bit of a meltdown\" after being unable to switch the character off, and wanted to shake his head just to be rid of him.\n\n\"I was seeing myself in him, but in my personal life,\" he said \"I remember having a bit of a meltdown at home and thinking, like, 'I'm going to shave my head. I need to shave my head because I need to get rid of this character.'\n\n\"And, obviously, we were mid-shooting, so I decided not to\u2026 It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the London-born actor has addressed such concerns. As last year, he announced he was stepping back from social media, saying he finds it can be \"detrimental\" to his mental health.\n\nThe year before Holland said he was considering giving up acting, which he began aged 11, altogether in order to be able to \"go and do other things\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:How much did the people running the Post Office get paid while the flawed Horizon system was in place?\n\nBy looking through the company accounts for the Post Office and Royal Mail, the BBC has come up with a figure - \u00a319.4m over 24 years.\n\nBefore 2012, Royal Mail and the Post Office were part of the same organisation - and its three successive chief executives, John Roberts, Adam Crozier and Dame Moya Greene, made a total of \u00a312.8m. All three of them are due to appear at Horizon Inquiry which resumes on 9 April.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the chief executives of the separated Post Office, Paula Vennells then Nick Read, have made a total of \u00a36.5m.\n\nThat's an average of less than \u00a31m a year - compared to the \u00a33.91m the average boss of Britain's 100 biggest listed companies earned in 2022.\n\nIt's a huge sum compared to the salary of average workers, or for sub-postmasters still waiting for compensation.\n\nThe Post Office argues that it is a very large, complex business which has to compete with other organisations for talent, and uses external consultants to advise on executive pay. So who are the Post Office bosses and what did each of them earn?\n\nMr Read, a former captain of Dragoons who had been chief executive of Nisa Retail, joined in September 2019, a few months after 550 sub-postmasters won a dramatic High Court victory.\n\nHe agreed a much higher base salary than his predecessor, Ms Vennells, earning \u00a3415,000 a year compared to her \u00a3255", "ulled back\" on promises to restrict junk food advertising.\n\nThe government said it would continue to work with industry to help people make healthier choices.\n\nMr Dimbleby said he was stepping back from his role because he wanted to be free to speak out against government policy.\n\n\"I think the ideology of the Conservative Party and the way that they are dealing with the problem of diet-related disease makes no sense,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"In 10 years' time, whatever government is in power they are going to be dealing with huge problems to the NHS, which is going to suck money from the rest of government spending and cause misery from diet-related disease.\"\n\nHe blamed a \"feedback loop between companies and their commercial incentives and our appetite\", adding that \"the government needs to intervene\".\n\nBut instead, Mr Dimbleby said \"this modern Conservative ideology just thinks it can leave everything in the system without any intervention at all\", with the government reluctant to be seen as taking a \"nanny state\" approach.\n\nHe argued that voters, including those in so-called Red Wall areas - former Labour seats which the Tories are keen to keep hold of - wanted the government to act because \"they're fed up of their children being marketed junk food\".\n\nMr Dimbleby was a non-executive board member at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for five years.\n\nAs part of his role he conducted an independent review of the food system. The report's recommendations included measures such as taxing the salt and sugar in processed foods, with some of the revenues used to provide fresh fruit and vegetables to low-income families.\n\nHowever, Mr Dimbleby was critical of the government's response to the review, saying many of his policy recommendations had not been taken forward.\n\nLast year, the government delayed a planned ban on \"buy one get one free\" offers on unhealthy foods in England until October 2023 to assess the impact on household finances in light of the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nA ban on TV advertising of junk food before 21:00 has also been pushed back to October 2025 to give the industry more time to prepare for the restrictions.\n\nAn estimated 26% of adults in England are obese, while a further 38% are overweight, according to the latest NHS figures.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We take tackling obesity seriously and we will continue to work closely with industry to make it easier for people to make healthier choices.\n\n\"We recently announced \u00a320m to trial new obesity treatments and technologies to help save the NHS billions, and remain committed to introducing restrictions banning adverts on TV for foods and drinks high in fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) before 9pm, as well as paid-for adverts online.\"Last updated on .From the section Scottish Premiership\n\nRabbi Matondo's stunning stoppage-time equaliser prevented Celtic extending their Scottish Premiership lead as Rangers came from behind twice late on to draw a six-goal Old Firm classic.\n\nIt had looked like Adam Idah's clinical finish six minutes earlier was going to put Celtic four points clear, the goal coming just 71 seconds after fellow substitute Abdallah Sima's deflected strike dragged the hosts level from two goals down.\n\nBut Matondo completed the scoring in a scarcely-believable eight-minute finale to leave the teams separated by just one point, with Rangers having played one game fewer.\n\nCeltic had cruised into a commanding lead after a sensational first-half display, during which Daizen Maeda scored after 21 seconds when James Tavernier's clearance crashed off him and fizzed past Jack Butland.\n\nIn a VAR-affected contest, Matt O'Riley dinked in a composed penalty - awarded by referee John Beaton after an on-field review showed Connor Goldson had handled - to send the away side into the break two goals ahead.\n\nBut Tavernier, who endured a torrid first half, slammed in a spot-kick of his own after Beaton reversed his decision to book Fabio Silva for diving under the challenge of Alistair Johnston.\n\nCyriel Dessers then thought he had prodded in a leveller a minute later, only for Beaton to rule it out after another visit to the screen for a foul by Tom Lawrence on Tomoki Iwata.\n\nRangers then huffed and puffed until bedlam ensued in a wild ending - including a bout of pushing and shoving - to leave it as you were at the summit.\n\u2022 None What has changed in title race after Old Firm epic?\n\u2022 None What did Old Firm fans make of derby draw?\n\u2022 None Podcast: 'Celtic still have Rangers at home - that's critical'\n\u2022 None Everything you need to know about Celtic\n\nIt's hard to think of a better Old Firm in recent memory.\n\nIn the last decade and more, derbies by the time clocks have sprung forward have often held little significance. Not this one.\n\nTime was standing still in Glasgow for a pivotal fixture in the tightest title race between the pair since 2011. By the full-time whistle, heads were spinning.\n\nBilled a must-not-lose for both, pressure was on Rangers to prove they could hurdle the mental barrier of defeating Celtic in a meaningful league encounter.\n\nNot since August 2021 have they managed that, but this point will feel like three given the way the first half went.\n\nA fever-pitch Ibrox was bordering on turning toxic. Rangers were poor; Celtic were sublime and should have been out of sight.\n\nDespite the visitors hitting the back of Butland's net twice, the Rangers keeper kept his side in the game with England coach Gareth Southgate watching on, denying Maeda before tipping over O'Riley's header.\n\nAt the other end, Goldson ought to have scored with a header of his own and Silva was thwarted twice by Joe Hart. But make no mistake, Rangers were well off it.\n\nThe second half was a different story, though. Even despite Dessers' disallowed goal and Idah's instant response, Clement's side still managed to find a way to salvage a point from an absolute classic.\n\nOne point remains the margin, good luck to you if you want to predict how it unfolds from here.\n\nWhere do you begin? An Old Firm derby for the ages.\n\nAt the break, those Rangers fans were watching a repeat of their most-watched horror movie.\n\nCeltic asserted their derby dominance and were everyone's safe bet for the title when both sides headed down the tunnel at the interval.\n\nBut Clement has instilled a resilient mentality in this Rangers side, which was needed firstly to come from two down, then required again just a minute later when Idah drilled in.\n\nRangers will reclaim top spot by winning their game in hand at Dundee on Wednesday, so naturally there will still be talk of pendulums swinging and momentum shifting in the aftermath of this one.\n\nBut that fixture only highlights the unpredictability of this title race. Strapping yourself in tight may be the best advice.\n\nWhat they said\n\nRangers manager Philippe Clement: \"I don't know if it was classic, but my boys did something special. It was the worst way to start the game. But we showed our real quality and personality.\n\n\"We get a well-deserved point. We are more the winners of the day. Everybody sees this team is totally different from five months ago. It could have been more, but I think the result is also good.\"\n\nCeltic manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We're disappointed not to win, but to leave here with everything in our hands is what we wanted.\n\n\"We've played well, showed quality and heart in really tough conditions. There's still a lot to play for. There's a long way to go. We're in a really good position.\"\n\nRangers go to Dundee on Wednesday (20:00 BST) before concluding their pre-split fixtures at Ross County next Sunday (12:00).\n\nCeltic are back in action the day before at home to St Mirren (15:00).\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

Rangers 3, Celtic", "\"welcoming and vibrant school\", where staff-pupil relationships were \"warm and supportive\", and bullying was rare.\n\nBut it also highlighted a lack of \"appropriate supervision during break times\", which meant pupils were \"potentially at risk of harm\".\n\nAn Ofsted spokesperson said: \"We are surprised by claims that Ofsted has ignored requests to engage in discussions with the NAHT.\n\n\"Amanda Spielman has met senior NAHT representatives twice in the last week, and she has clearly indicated Ofsted's willingness to continue having constructive discussions about these issues.\"\n\nFollowing calls for inspections to be paused, Ms Spielman previously said it was \"unquestionably a difficult time to be a head teacher\".\n\nShe acknowledged that the debate about removing grades, where a school is given an overall mark of outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate, is a \"legitimate one\".\n\nBut she added that the grades do give parents \"a simple and accessible summary of a school's strengths and weaknesses\" and are used by the government to identify struggling schools.\n\n\"I don't believe that stopping or preventing inspections would be in children's best interests. Our aim is to raise standards, so that all children get a great education\" she added.\n\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article you can visit the BBC Action Line pages, or contact Samaritans.Rock band Maneskin won last year's Eurovision and have gone on to score top 10 hits in the US, the UK and the rest of Europe\n\nRussia will no longer be allowed to participate in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union has said.\n\nThe EBU, which produces the event, said Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\".\n\nRussia launched an attack on its neighbour Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nWestern governments have ramped up international sanctions in response.\n\nJust 24 hours ago, the contest had said Russia would be allowed to compete, so this is a rapid change in stance for the EBU.\n\nIt follows the announcement that football's 2022 Champions League final would be played in Paris, after Russia was stripped of the match following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nF1's Russian Grand Prix, due to take place in Sochi in September, was also cancelled.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC urged the EBU to suspend Russia's Eurovision membership and ban it from the contest.\n\nState broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands had called for Russia to be banned from the contest.\n\nFinland said if Russia took part, it would not send a representative to the contest in Turin in May.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.\"\n\nThe 66th edition of Eurovision is due to take place in Turin, after Italian rock band Maneskin won the 2021 contest.\n\nManizha represented Russia at last year's Eurovision Song Contest with an ode to female empowerment, Russian Woman\n\nRussia had not announced its act for the contest, which it last won in 2008 with Dima Bilan singing Believe.\n\nIn recent years, it has been one of the strongest Eurovision performers, with five top five finishes in the past decade.\n\nUkraine has selected hip-hop trio Kalush Orchestra, whose song Stefania was written as a tribute to their mothers.\n\nThe band replaced the country's original contestant, Alina Pash, who withdrew last week after facing scrutiny over a trip she made to Russia-controlled Crimea in 2015.\n\nWhile there is no suggestion Pash entered Crimea from Russia, she said the controversy over her visit had overshadowed her participation in the contest.\n\nThe Ukrainian government considers people who enter the territory via Russia to have crossed the border illegally.\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine have overshadowed previous editions of the song contest.\n\nRussia were favourites to win the competition in 2016, until Ukrainian singer Jamala stole a last-minute victory with a song that depicted the deportation of Crimean Tatars by Josef Stalin in 1944 - a horrific chapter the nation's parliament has described as tantamount to genocide.\n\nThe lyrics were widely interpreted as a criticism of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Jamala, who is herself a Crimean Tartar, appeared to confirm the link when she told the press: \"The main message is to remember and to know this story. When we know, we prevent.\"\n\nOn the path to victory, her song picked up several important votes from former Soviet countries who have traditionally voted for Russia. Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor called the result \"a pointed slap in Russia's face\".\n\nA year later, Russian contestant Julia Samoylova was blocked from entering Ukraine, which was hosting the competition, because she had reportedly toured Crimea without entering it through the border with the Ukrainian mainland.\n\nRussian television station Channel One then announced it would not broadcast the contest or take part.\n\nJamala has now called on Eurovision fans not to ignore Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't know how this is possible, but they bombed peaceful people,\" she said in an Instagram video. \"Please support Ukraine.

I have no issue with anyone's religion, whether it be Protestant, Catholic, Judaism - whatever; I don't care.\n\n\"All I am interested in is the person that I know. But when we are celebrating terrorism, I think it is a disgrace.\"\n\nMs Magee said she did not think Mr Finucane should be at the event on Sunday.\n\n\"I don't think any MP should be at some kind of commemoration to celebrate a terrorist,\" she added.\n\n\"I mean what did that bomb in Coleraine achieve, by killing six pensioners? What did it achieve, other than it robbed families of their loved ones?\"\n\nAn event to remember those killed in the Coleraine atrocity is due to take place on Monday, and a permanent memorial to the victims will be unveiled.\n\nMs Magee was 10 at the time of her grandmother's death and described the impact on the family.\n\n\"I remember vividly my mum being hysterical,\" she added.\n\n\"It was just an awful time for the family.\n\n\"There were three siblings and the youngest one lived in England and he was very, very close to his mother.\n\n\"He's still alive. He's 80-odd now and if you were to speak to him about it now, at 80-odd he would still cry.\"\n\nSix people were killed when the bomb exploded in Coleraine in 1973\n\nMr Finucane's father, solicitor Pat Finucane, was shot dead by loyalist gunmen at his home in Belfast in 1989.\n\nA woman whose husband was shot dead by loyalists in Kennedy Way in west Belfast in January 1973 called BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show on Friday.\n\nMary from Lurgan, County Armagh, said Mr Finucane should \"think strongly\" about what he was planning to do.\n\n\"John should know exactly how I feel.

I won't ever forget this.\"\n\nThe singer burst onto the stage shortly after 21:00 BST with Pinball", "20,000 people - including 1,500 young people - taken by a nurse on a few different occasions to obtain an average reading.\n\nDr Pauline Swift, from the charity Blood Pressure UK, said while some risk factors, such as ageing and ethnicity, are unavoidable, others are within people's control.\n\n\"In recent years we have seen an increase in younger patients with high blood pressure, often as a result of poor diet, consuming too much salt and lack of exercise leading to weight gain,\" she said.\n\n\"If you start making small changes to your lifestyle when you are young, such as eating less salt, more fruit and vegetables and taking more exercise to maintain a healthy weight, then you are more likely to stay healthier and prevent strokes, heart disease and chronic kidney disease.\n\n\"High blood pressure kills thousands of people every year in the UK and is almost entirely preventable.\n\n\"Everyone needs to take control of their health by checking their blood pressure either at home, at a pharmacy or with their practice nurse. This could save your life.\"\n\nProf Bryan Williams, President of the International Society of Hypertension, and a specialist at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in London, said: \"I just don't think people realise just how dangerous untreated high blood pressure can be.\n\n\"It is estimated that high blood pressure causes 10 million deaths every year across the world. To put this in perspective, that is more deaths globally every year than the total number of global deaths caused by Covid over three years.\n\n\"The good news is that once high blood pressure is properly diagnosed, for most people it is easy to treat and control, especially if it is diagnosed early.\n\n\"If I have a simple message it is, get your blood pressure checked and don't ignore it if it is high.\"\n\nBlood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The healthy range is between 90 over 60mmHg and 120 over 80mmHg.General Ivan Popov has been commanding forces in the Zaporizhzhia region\n\nA top Russian general says he has been removed from his post in Ukraine after telling military chiefs the truth about the dire situation on the front line.\n\nMaj Gen Ivan Popov was the commander of the 58th Army, which has been fighting in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nIn a voice message, Maj Gen Popov said he raised questions about high casualty rate and lack of artillery support.\n\n\"It was necessary either to keep quiet and be a coward or to say it the way it is,\" he said.\n\n\"I had no right to lie in the name of you, in the name of my fallen comrades in arms, so I outlined all the problems which exist.\"\n\nThe voice message was posted to telegram by Russian MP Andrei Gurulyov, who is a former military commander and frequent commentator on state TV. It is unclear when the message was recorded.\n\nAmong the issues Maj Gen Popov said he highlighted to his superiors were the lack of proper counter battery systems to help repel Ukrainian artillery attacks, as well as a lack of military intelligence.\n\nThe commander said his dismissal was demanded by senior commanders - who he accused of treason - and approved by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.\n\nRussian military bloggers - often the most insightful form of information in the absence of official comment from Moscow - reported that the order to dismiss Maj Gen Popov had come from the head of Russia's armed forces, Gen Valery Gerasimov.\n\nThey said Gen Gerasimov accused Maj Gen Popov of \"alarmism and blackmailing senior management\" after he highlighted the need to rotate soldiers who had been in the front line for a sustained period of time and had suffered significant losses.\n\n\"The senior chiefs apparently sensed some kind of danger from me and quickly concocted an order from the defence minister in just one day and got rid of me,\" Maj Gen Popov said.\n\n\"The Ukrainian army could not break through our ranks at the front but our senior chief hit us from the rear, viciously beheading the army at the most difficult and intense moment.\"\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has yet to comment on the dismissal.\n\nHowever, a senior official of the pro-government United Russia party, of which Mr Gurulyov is a member, criticised the MP for making a \"political show\" out of Maj Gen Popov's remarks.\n\n\"General Popov's statement was not public and was posted on closed chats of the commanders and troops of the 58th Army,\" Andrei Turchak wrote on telegram.\n\n\"Let the fact that... Gurulyov somehow got hold of this and made a political show out of it remain on his conscience,\" he said, adding that Maj Gen Popov's conscience was clear and the country could be proud of commanders like him.\n\nZaporizhzhia and the eastern Donetsk region have become the focus of Ukraine's counteroffensive, which was launched over a month ago, but has struggled to penetrate well established Russian defensive lines.\n\nOn Wednesday, another Russian MP said former Russian commander Gen Sergei Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, was \"resting\".\n\nGen Surovikin was said to enjoy close relations with the former Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and there had been media reports that he had been arrested following the brief revolt.\n\nThere has been no official confirmation or comment about his whereabouts.\n\nMeanwhile, another senior Russian general - Lt Gen Oleg Tsokov - is said to have been killed in a strike in Ukraine's occupied south coast this week, although his death has not been officially confirmed by Russia's defence ministry.Eintracht Frankfurt fans have clashed with police in Italy ahead of their club's Champions League last-16 match against Napoli.\n\nFootage showed chairs being hurled at riot police, who had been responding with tear gas.\n\nNaples authorities had banned residents of the German city from buying tickets for the match, after violence during the first leg in Frankfurt.\n\nMore on this story: Eintracht fans clash with police before Napoli tie\"There is no free lunch\" when it comes to funding public companies such as Thames Water, Lord Howard has told the BBC.\n\nThe firm, which is billions of pounds in debt, faces a crisis, prompting fresh calls for it to be nationalised.\n\nLord Howard, who led the privatisation of the water industry more than 30 years ago, denied the plan has failed.\n\nGreen Party's Caroline Lucas said water firms should be placed under public ownership.\n\nThames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, has faced heavy criticism over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks, with its chief executive quitting last week.\n\nThe company is in talks to secure extra funding, and the government has said \"a lot of work is going on behind the scenes\" and that a process was in place \"if necessary\".\n\nLord Howard, who was the minister charged with privatising the water under industry under Margaret Thatcher's government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that long-term investments in infrastructure required major investment.\n\n\"You can pay for them by borrowing, in which case interest has to be paid to the lenders, or you can pay for them by raising private capital, in which case dividends have to be paid to the people who provide that capital,\" he said.\n\n\"That is the only choice available, there is no free lunch.\"\n\nLord Howard said industries under public ownership must \"compete for resources\" with the likes of health, education and police, saying that when water was nationalised it was \"way down the queue\".\n\n\"When you release it into the private sector, you have recourse to private capital - you can make the investment that's needed,\" said Lord Howard, who was also the former Conservative party leader.\n\nHowever, he accepted with hindsight that some companies should have been raising more of their capital through issuing equity.\n\n\"I think it is arguable that the companies have been allowed to take on too much debt,\" he said.\n\nAnother Conservative peer, Lord Tyrie, said it would be a \"mistake\" to renationalise water companies, as they were \"better off... in the private sector, subject to some discipline in the market\".\n\nA process of renationalising would be \"disruptive\", with costs passed onto customers through higher bills over a \"sustained period\", he told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster.\n\nBut Lord Tyrie, the former chair of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), criticised \"poor quality regulation\" of the sector - and called for", "ate\" that the information initially provided by the police appears not to have been \"entirely correct\".\n\n\"It's important, if we're going to have trust and confidence between the community [and] the local police force\u2026 there has to be openness and clarity,\" added Mr Brennan.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said what had happened was \"appalling and completely unacceptable\".\n\nThe IOPC has said its investigators will examine \"any interaction between the police and the boys\".\n\nIOPC director, David Ford, said: \"It is important that we independently investigate the circumstances leading up to this tragic event.\n\n\"This incident and the events that followed have, understandably, attracted significant interest and public concern.\n\n\"It is important that we thoroughly and independently investigate this matter, in order to establish the full facts and circumstances of exactly what happened on Monday.\"\n\nAre you in the area?

Two are at a reservoir in Rutland with the others on the coast in Plymouth, as well as the River Deben in Suffolk.\n\n\"The actions we have taken mean that people across the country will be able to swim at more sites and in better quality water, but we know there is more to do,\" says Water Minister Rebecca Pow.\n\nThere are already 421 designated bathing water sites in England. The vast majority of them are coastal with just two, in Yorkshire on the River Wharfe and Oxfordshire, on the Thames on rivers.\n\nApplicants for official bathing status are asked to provide evidence of local support, data on how many people swim at the site and whether there are facilities nearby, such as toilets.\n\nKirsty Davies, community water quality officer for campaign group Surfers Against Sewage called the rejections \"a slap in the face for communities who are trying to tackle the sewage pollution crisis.\"\n\n\"It's a Catch 22,\" Ms Davies said. \"They won't care for waters that aren't designated, but we apply for designation, and they decline.\"\n\nOne of those turned down is at Wallingford on the River Thames. In a statement South Oxfordshire District council said they were \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision and were seeking clarification on the reasons behind it.\n\nIn 2020 part of the Wharfe in Ilkley became the first UK river to be designated as a bathing site, in what was then seen as a major victory for water quality campaigners. But efforts to get three more stretches of the Wharfe officially designated have been rejected.\n\nCouncillor Linda Richards, who had been working on the designation told the BBC that they had been sent emails which said they'd failed to meet the criteria but didn't explain why.\n\n\"This is a disappointing setback but not the end of the road,\" she said, explaining that they would bid for designated status again.\n\nA spokesperson for DEFRA said they would not comment on individual applications but that sites that did not meet criteria would not progress to national consultation.BBC Sport research has found evidence of 81 individual short-haul domestic flights made by Premier League teams to and from 100 matches during a two-month sample period this year.\n\nWhether it's Trent Alexander-Arnold on a flight back from Newcastle to Liverpool, Chelsea's Ben Chilwell flying from London to Leicester or Nottingham Forest players on their way from East Midlands Airport to Blackpool, occasional social media posts have so far been the only insight to inform the debate around Premier League clubs flying small distances to matches instead of travelling by road or rail.\n\nNow, a study of 100 games played in the UK involving Premier League teams between 19 January and 19 March 2023 has given the first insight into the volume of the controversial journeys, some as short as 27 minutes.\n\nAnd for the first time the study also shows details of 'positioning' flights - where near-empty planes are flown to convenient airports, sometimes across the UK, in order to then transport players and staff to fixtures.\n\u2022 None The Sports Desk podcast: Should Premier League clubs stop flying to domestic games?\n\u2022 None Of those 81 flights, the breakdown was 59 flights for Premier League fixtures; 16 for FA Cup games and six for EFL Cup matches\n\u2022 None The shortest flight was just 27 77\n\u2022 None The average duration of these 81 flights was 42\n\nBBC Sport contacted all Premier League clubs with the flight information.\n\nIn addition to these 'player movement' flights, the research also suggested a significant number of connected 'positioning' flights. The study found:\n\u2022 37 of the 81 player flights had a flight marked as 'positioning' beforehand\n\u2022 None The average duration of the 37 'positioning' flights in the study was 42\n\nFlights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.\n\nEmissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport, with short-haul flights the worst emitters, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\u2022 None Should clubs stop flying to domestic matches for environmental reasons?\n\u2022 None Find out more about sport and climate change\n\nWhat about these 'positioning' flights?\n\n'Positioning' flights are where the plane is getting into position to pick up its private charter passengers. They are normally what the aviation industry calls \"empty leg\" flights - so without passengers and therefore qualify as 'ghost' flights, a term increasingly being used to describe any flight with fewer than 10% passengers.\n\nBBC Sport contacted the airlines involved but received no confirmation as to the number of passengers on these flights.\n\nAs the Premier League's most southerly team, Bournemouth perhaps have more justification than others to fly to some games. They flew to Birmingham airport and back on the weekend of 17-18 March for their fixture with Aston Villa - a return journey totalling 73 minutes.\n\nBut the data pointed towards a further four 'positioning flights' connected to this trip - three of which were to or from Scotland - totalling an additional 201 minutes.\n\nIn addition to the 37 marked positioning flights, the BBC Sport research also observed instances of planes flying from one London airport to another in advance of a player flight - although not marked as 'positioning' flights. It is therefore possible the actual number could be higher.\n\u2022 None Green Football Weekend: What are clubs, players and fans doing?\n\nThe Premier League does not centrally mandate clubs' individual travel plans, but said in a statement to BBC Sport that it \"recognises the need to take action on climate change and is committed to reducing its overall climate impact\".\n\nThe statement added: \"Clubs have demonstrated their commitment to positive change in this area and continue to play an important role in raising awareness of the issue among fans, while also working on policies to improve environmental sustainability across their business operations.\"\n\nThose policies, the Premier League pointed out, include more sustainable fan travel initiatives, use of renewable energy and conservation projects.\n\nThe scale of the emissions\n\nThe Premier League pointed out that in the two-month period of the BBC Sport research, there were", "\n\nThis article is the second in a series this week which will examine the future direction of unionism and politics in Northern Ireland.

The singer did not provide an update on his wife's health.\n\nSheeran was writing to fans to announce the release of - (Subtract), an Aaron Dessner-produced acoustic album that was written against \"a backdrop of grief and hope\".\n\nThe album was long-planned as the conclusion to his \"mathematical era\", which began with + (Plus) in 2011, and continued with x (Multiply), \u00f7 (Divide) and = (Equals).\n\nBut the entire project was rewritten in a week-long outpouring of emotions, as the star was \"spiralling through fear, depression and anxiety\" last February.\n\nIt came after Edwards - who gave Sheeran his first big break - suddenly died from a heart attack after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner concluded.\n\nShortly afterwards, Sheeran faced a three-week copyright trial, over claims he had plagiarised his hit song Shape Of You.\n\nAlthough he eventually won, the singer and his co-writer, Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, said the case had put an \"extraordinary strain\" on them.\n\nTo get through those experiences, Sheeran used songwriting to \"make sense\" of his feelings.\n\n\"I felt like I was drowning, head below the surface, looking up but not being able to break through for air,\" he recalled.\n\nArtwork for the album was shot by famed US photographer Annie Leibovitz\n\n\"I wrote without thought of what the songs would be, I just wrote whatever tumbled out. And in just over a week, I replaced a decade's worth of work with my deepest, darkest thoughts.\n\n\"For the first time I'm not trying to craft an album people will like, I'm merely putting something out that's honest and true to where I am in my adult life.\n\n\"It's opening the trapdoor into my soul.\"\n\nThe album is due for release on 5 May, with Sheeran playing a handful of shows in London, Dublin, Glasgow, Manchester and Paris to debut the first single at the end of March.\n\nThe release comes shortly after January's one-off single F64, which was a visceral response to Jamal Edwards' death.\n\nThat song will not feature on the final tracklist, which was revealed on Wednesday morning.\n\nSheeran's mathematical quintology has made him one of Britain's biggest", "tsy was holding \u00a3899 of her money, which means she cannot afford to buy materials to keep producing.\n\nEtsy said payment reserves were used to \"keep the marketplace safe\" and cover any potential refunds.\n\nMs Collyer has been selling ceramics on Etsy since 2021. She said she was given only a few hours' notice before her money was put on reserve.\n\n\"This is ruining my business - I can't afford to buy any clay or glazes. We might have to move house because I can't pay any bills,\" she said.\n\nDan said Etsy was holding \u00a37,000 of his money\n\nEtsy's payment policy states the reasons for putting money on hold include a sudden increase in sales, a shop having only made its first sale recently, the shop committing a \"policy violation\" or \"other risk factors\".\n\nSome sellers told the BBC that two reserve periods were imposed on them consecutively.\n\nDan sells made-to-order wood furniture on the site and told the BBC he had no idea why his money was being held.\n\n\"Etsy are holding around \u00a37,000 of my money, leaving us to use credit cards and family loans to try and keep our business running and keep food on the table,\" said the 44-year-old from Buckinghamshire.\n\nHis partner Sam said: \"There is no ability to have the reserve lifted within the 90 days, you must see out the full period. It's destroyed my business.\"\n\nJoanna said she would not trade on Etsy after it put her on a reserve - then lifted it with no explanation\n\nJoanna, who ran a bespoke underwear shop on Etsy, told the BBC she too could see no reason for her funds being withheld, and so suddenly.\n\n\"I have been selling [on Etsy] for four years,\" she said. \"I woke up to a communication... stating that my account has been put on a 90-day period of reserve whereby they will hold 75% of my sales.\n\n\"We have no cases against us, we have performed no malpractice in any way,\" she said, adding that her account was not restored to normal even after following the site's guidance on lifting the reserve.\n\nThe 62-year-old said she would have made \u00a35,000 this month and cannot take out a loan while she waits for the money.\n\nThe BBC has seen emails from Etsy sent to sellers saying it can't explain why it is withholding people's money\n\n\"I cancelled all my on-reserve orders and put my shop on vacation. I won't trade with them. I can't afford to,\" she said.\n\nAnd almost as suddenly as the reserve was implemented, it was lifted. She received no explanation for either decision.\n\nSellers on Etsy had their payments delayed earlier in the year following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).\n\nEtsy used SVB to issue money to some of those that sell goods on the site.\n\nBut Etsy said only a small proportion of sellers had their pay-outs delayed as a result of the collapse.\n\nThe BBC spoke to more than 20 sellers who had similar complaints. One, a disabled seller for whom Etsy is her only source of income, said the company stated it was taking \"no complaints\" on the issue. Etsy told her it \"isn't able to give... [a] specific reason\" for withholding thousands of pounds of her takings.\n\nMany sellers wished to remain anonymous for fear of having their shops taken off the platform. The BBC has seen complaints about the reserve system from the US and various countries in the EU.\n\n\"If you challenge them or speak out, or don't accept their terms and conditions, your account becomes disabled,\" one independent UK seller told us.\n\nEtsy disputes this and says that it wouldn't retaliate against a seller for voicing their opinion. It says it takes seller feedback very seriously.\n\nHundreds of affected Etsy sellers are planning a \"strike\", or boycott and are organising on various online groups.\n\nAn Etsy spokesperson said that the vast majority of sellers receive their funds when they make a sale. They added that the reserve system was used by many online sellers.\n\nHowever, Amazon's level of reserve is much lower, at around 3% for established sellers until any disputes are resolved.\n\nThe Small Business Commissioner, Liz Barclay, said Etsy's \"level of reserve is new to us\".\n\nShe added that while she had no remit across complaints made against non-UK companies, \"there have been more complaints recently\" made against the US-based firm.\n\nMs Barclay said the commission was receiving reports of \"many small firms owed several thousands of pounds\", which was \"heart breaking at a time when people are struggling with the rising cost of living on top of huge increases in costs of business bills and materials\".\n\n\"My big worry is that for hundreds of thousands of businesses, this is their only source of income. Anecdotally, we hear that many sellers are women or minority groups and they need this money to pay the bills,\" Ms Barclay said\n\nEtsy is an online marketplace that allows independent sellers to set up their own shop. It specialises in bespoke items, handicrafts or things not usually available in High Street shops.\n\nEtsy Inc. is a US-based company which trades its shares on the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York, where it listed its stock in 2015. Etsy's shares currently trading at $99 each - a far cry from an all time high of $294 during the Covid pandemic in 2021.\n\nIts biggest shareholders are major financial institutions such as Vanguard Group, BlackRock and JP Morgan.\n\nThe company is led by chief executive Josh Silverman who has worked at an eclectic mix of businesses such as online auction site eBay, the internet chat firm Skype and American Express.

The decision came after complaints from local farmers who said they were being undercut by cheaper Ukrainian grain flooding their markets.\n\nOn Sunday, Polish Economic Development and Technology Minister Waldemar Buda clarified that the ban applied to goods in transit as well as those staying in Poland.\n\nHe called for talks with Ukraine to set up a scheme to ensure exports pass through Poland and do not end up on the local market.\n\nA statement by Ukraine's Agriculture Ministry said it had \"always been sympathetic to the situation in the Polish agricultural sector and responded promptly to various challenges\".\n\n\"At present, unilateral drastic actions will not accelerate the positive resolution of the situation,\" it added.\n\nMinisters from Poland and Ukraine are due to meet to discuss the issue in Poland on Monday.The beach was cleared, along with the nearby Pier Approach, and a cordon set up\n\nA 12-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy who died after being pulled from the sea off Bournemouth beach were not hit by any vessels, police have said.\n\nOfficers released more information regarding what happened on Wednesday when 10 swimmers got into difficulty.\n\nA man in his 40s arrested on suspicion of manslaughter has been released under investigation.\n\nDorset Police said there was no contact with a jet ski or boat and no-one jumped from the pier.\n\nThe force stressed investigations were still in the early stages and it was only releasing certain details to address speculation.

He denies going to the party in the year the prosecution claim.\n\nThe 63-year-old has pleaded not guilty to 12 sexual offence charges against four men between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSir Elton appeared by video link from Monaco. He answered questions around whether Mr Spacey had ever attended the White Tie and Tiara Ball that the musician held every year at his home.\n\nThe singer said Mr Spacey attended in 2001. One of the actor's accusers had given evidence to say a sexual assault happened on route to the ball in 2002, which Spacey denies attending.\n\nSpeaking about the ball in 2001, Sir Elton said: \"Yes, he came in white tie, and he came straight from a private jet. Yes, I don't think he'd wear white tie otherwise.\"\n\nSir Elton said Mr Spacey stayed overnight at his home in Windsor after the event, but could not remember him visiting the property after that.\n\nSir Elton's husband, David Furnish, also gave evidence and said he remembered Mr Spacey attending the event in question, adding \"as an Oscar-winning actor, there was a lot of excitement he was at the ball\".\n\nMr Spacey denies three counts of indecent assault, three counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.\n\nHe also denies four further charges of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.\n\nThe Hollywood star won an Oscar for Best Actor in 2000 for American Beauty as well as Emmy nominations for his role in House of Cards.Former Shell boss Ben van Beurden received a pay package of \u00a39.7m last year, up more than 50% from 2021.\n\nHis pay was revealed in the oil and gas giant's annual report and accounts.\n\nShell reported the highest annual profits in its 115-year history last year after a surge in energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMassive profits made by energy firms have added to pressure to tax them more as households struggle with rising energy bills.\n\nWhen its results came out in February, opposition parties said the company's profits were \"outrageous\" and that the government was letting energy firms \"off the hook\" on taxation.\n\nIn 2021, Mr van Beurden was paid the equivalent of \u00a36.3m - he was paid in euros because Shell had yet to move its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain.\n\nHe was replaced on 1 January this year by Wael Sawan, the former head of Shell's gas and renewables business.\n\nThe annual report said Mr Sawan was appointed on a salary of \u00a31.4m, although performance-related payments can often add to the overall pay package considerably. Mr van Beurden's salary was \u00a31.4m in 2022.\n\nMr van Beurden's pay package was criticised by human rights and environment charity Global Witness.\n\n\"It's a sign of just how broken our energy system is that Shell and other fossil fuel companies have made record-breaking profits from an energy crisis that's forcing families to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table,\" said Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness.\n\n\"We're calling on the UK government to implement a people-first windfall tax in next week's Spring Budget, which includes executive bonuses.\"\n\nDean Bruckner, policy director at the UK Shareholders' Association, which campaigns for shareholders' rights, said he had concerns that Mr van Beurden's pay package looked \"indefensible\".\n\nHe said pay settlements such as this risk bringing \"the corporate world into disrepute\".\n\nInflation in the UK has been soaring, with huge increases in the cost of energy a key factor.\n\nAs prices rise across the board, putting pressure on struggling households, so oil and gas firms have been coming under political pressure.\n\nWhen he was chancellor, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought in a 25% Energy Profits Levy.\n\nThis was increased to 35% from January 2023 by current chancellor Jeremy Hunt, and will run until 2028.\n\nThe levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not on refining, or selling petrol and diesel.\n\nLess than 5% of Shell's profits come from UK production.\n\nThe scheme was criticised because it allowed oil firms an 80% investment allowance which overall allowed then to claim back 91p in every pound invested, including in oil and gas.\n\nThis investment allowance was reduced from 80% to 29% from 1 January.\n\nHowever, the biggest oil producer in the North Sea, Harbour Energy, has been a vocal critic of the tax.\n\nIt said on Thursday that the Energy Profits Levy had \"all but wiped out our profit for the year\". Harbour reported pre-tax profits of $2.5bn, but tax - including $1.5bn set aside for the levy - had left the company with $8m in post-tax profit.\n\nThe tax \"has driven us to reduce our UK investment and staffing levels,\" said its boss Linda Z. Cook, who used to be a Shell executive.\n\nShe added that it had given impetus to the firm to expand internationally.\n\nHarbour Energy has not gone ahead at drilling at two sites, and did not take part in the latest North Sea offshore licensing round, a spokesman said.\n\nThe planned job cuts are under consultation, the spokesman added.A huge metal construction girder has fallen onto a busy road in Bangkok, killing at least one person and critically injuring several more.\n\nRescue workers rushed to the scene to search for survivors from crushed cars and damaged buildings.\n\nThe girder was part of a project to build elevated highways in the city.\n\nBangkok's Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said the cause of the accident is not yet known.Linda Joyce-Jones says her cat Rosa used to follow her everywhere\n\nWhen Linda Joyce-Jones had to have her cat put down she was heartbroken.\n\nBut upon finding out her beloved pet Rosa may have been euthanised unnecessarily, her world fell apart and she tried to take her own life.\n\nNow the 59-year-old wants to make sure no other pet owner has to go through the same pain.\n\nShe has set up an independent mobile vet service and re-mortgaged her own home to fund it.\n\n\"I adopted Rosa in 2011 after she'd been abandoned by her previous owners,\" said Linda, a former", "in obvious pain after catching his foot in the turf with no opponent near him.\n\u2022 None What is happening with the Man Utd sale? Lisando Martinez's Argentina team-mates Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel helped to carry him off Having opted against replacing Marcus Rashford when his side were two goals up against Everton at the weekend and seeing the England man get injured, it was probably not a surprise when United boss Erik ten Hag took off key man Bruno Fernandes, plus Jadon Sancho and Anthony Martial after an hour. At that point United had a healthy advantage, with Sabitzer profiting from excellent through balls from Fernandes and Martial and Ten Hag presumably reasoned it was a wise option not to take a risk with so many big games to come, knowing Fernandes is banned for the second leg anyway after he picked up another yellow card. But the decision allowed Sevilla to gain some momentum. United's goal came under threat and eventually, their lead disappeared. Arguably though, the extent of Martinez's injury is of more concern.\n\u2022 None Martinez injury does not look great - Ten Hag The Argentine has been a rock at the heart of United's defence this season and, given the clear pain he was in as he sat sadly by the touchline waiting to be carried to the dressing rooms, there must be huge uncertainty over when he will play again, which could place his side's season under a threat that previously did not seem to exist. If there is some comfort to be taken from a night that ended so badly, it came from the performance of Martial. Ten Hag quoted \"stats\" in the build-up to the game when he said United were a better team with the Frenchman in it. The problem is that, since he arrived from Monaco in 2015, United fans have seen the 27-year-old be maddeningly frustrating, capable of brilliance in one moment before disappearing for extended periods - either figuratively in terms of his contribution to the team or literally by being injured. If ever there was a time for Martial to step up, this is it. No timescale has been put on Rashford's absence but even if it was just to the end of the month - and the belief is it will be slightly longer - that would take in the rest of this tie, the FA Cup semi-final with Brighton and a crucial league game at Tottenham in the battle to secure a Champions League spot. Martial has to stay fit and he has to perform. His contribution to Sabitzer's second goal emphasised why. Collecting the ball inside the Sevilla half, Martial took his time, created some space, then delivered a perfect through ball. Immediately after he scored, Sabitzer pointed to Martial in grateful acknowledgement. Martial's last involvement was to hold up possession superbly as United cleared their lines from a Sevilla attack, setting in motion a move that ended with Antony firing against the crossbar. Ten Hag has praised Wout Weghorst for his contribution but the on-loan Burnley forward is not in the same class. Ten Hag said afterwards he took Antony and Fernandes off to avoid them being red carded after being told the pair were on the last warnings. The United boss felt his side should have scored \"three or four\" but also conceded they were unlucky with injuries and the two late own goals. \"We have to learn and have to kill the game but everything is open,\" he added on BT Sport. \"When we didn't get the third and got some injuries we lost the rhythm in the game. We played well in the first half with a lot of belief, scored two great goals for Sabitzer and we could've scored even more, then after half time we lost control of the game. \"I know we can do better with these players in the last part of the game and we needed to be more composed, it was not a nice night.\" Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, a pundit on BT Sport, called the second half \"a complete disaster\". \"You never felt Sevilla put loads of pressure on United,\" he added. \"United must have felt this was going to be a stroll in the park.\"\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

Every leader. Do not wait for this to be forgotten,\" he said in a video address.\n\nUkraine's SBU security service said it was investigating the \"war crime\".\n\nThe Kremlin said the video was \"awful\" but its authenticity had to be checked as well as who was behind it.\n\nThe grainy and extremely graphic video appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, and possibly during the summer months. It shows a man in military uniform wearing a yellow armband - frequently worn as identifying symbols by Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThe perpetrator and other men visible in the clip have white bands on their legs, which Russian soldiers are known to wear as a means of identification.\n\nThey can also be heard to speak Russian, although that is not conclusive as many Ukrainians speak Russian too.\n\nDuring the short video, the victim with the yellow armband is beheaded by a man with a large knife who is wearing a white band around his leg.\n\nAt one point, one of the men holds up body armour with a trident mark - the state symbol of Ukraine.\n\nThe colours and shape of the trident badge are similar to the insignia of the Ukrainian ground forces.\n\nThe body armour also features what looks like the Punisher skull symbol (a comic-book character), which in the current conflict has been spotted being worn by fighters on both sides.\n\nA green passport-like booklet is also visible on the ground.\n\nIt's upside down in the video (highlighted below) but its appearance matches that of the standard-issue Ukrainian military ID in its colour, the presence of a Ukrainian trident symbol and the layout of the writing.\n\nThere has been speculation online that the video was filmed near the city of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe BBC has been unable to verify these claims as the video's surrounding features offer too few visual clues to identify its location, such as buildings or specific landscape points.\n\nIt also remains unclear when the footage was filmed. It looks as if it's from the current conflict, where white and yellow armbands have been used by opposing sides as identification.\n\nThe leaves in the video are bright green which suggests that it may have been from late spring or summer last year.\n\nSome social media users have suggested it may have been filmed in July but we cannot verify this.\n\nThe footage began circulating on Telegram late on Tuesday, after a popular pro-Kremlin blogger shared it with his nearly 300,000 followers.\n\nHe later claimed he was not the original source of the video and that the footage had been on Telegram before he posted it.

When I look back at how I started Starling, I never thought we would get to this stage.\n\n\"Starling is bigger than just one person, it is bigger than a founder-led organisation. It is a piece of infrastructure that is important to the UK. We provide a real role in society.\"\n\nMs Boden, 63, said it was \"not really appropriate\" for Starling to continue to have a shareholder as its chief executive. She still owns 4.9% of the company and keeps a seat on the board as a non-executive director.\n\nStarling Bank said it has begun a global search for a new chief executive, with chief operating officer John Mountain taking the interim role.\n\nThe departing chief executive says she had become ashamed to be a banker before launching Starling\n\nStarling has grown steadily from its initial base of personal customers, adding business accounts and acquiring a mortgage book, partly due to its purchase of Fleet Mortgages.\n\nMs Boden, decided to pursue her dream of launching a bank after becoming disenchanted with the banking world.\n\n\"People never believed that a 5ft tall Welsh woman in her mid-50s could do something that had never been done before,\" she said.\n\n\"I had become ashamed to be a banker, I was ashamed to be part of that whole regime that had let the country down.\n\n\"I wanted to do something different, I wanted to found a bank that was really good for customers, that was fair.

They lived in Baladiya street in Khartoum, next to the military headquarters and the British embassy. It became a battlefield for the two warring parties - Sudan's army, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nAzhaar's 85-year-old grandfather Abdalla Sholgami was a British citizen. He was shot three times in Khartoum\n\nMr Sholgami, a British citizen, was shot three times, leaving his disabled wife alone at home. He somehow survived, and his family are now trying to evacuate him from Sudan.\n\nBut there was no word about his wife and Azhaar's grandmother, Alaweya. Weeks of Azhaar's frantic phone calls to the British embassy failed to get help.\n\nHer grandparents couldn't make their way to the airfield for the evacuation of British citizens, so they were left stuck in Khartoum.\n\nThree days ago she got a call from the Turkish embassy, also located next to the house, saying her grandmother was dead.\n\nAzhaar didn't want to believe it.\n\n\"I called back again and said, 'Maybe she's in a coma, did you check her pulse? Did you check her body, see if her heart is beating?'

She didn't want us to reveal her name because she fears she might be targeted, but told us this story.\n\nAhmad's family was gathering at the home of a relative so they could evacuate together. He realised he'd forgotten his paperwork, so he returned to his home in the Riyadh neighbourhood and never came back.\n\nSix days later his brother got a call from someone trying to identify a body lying in front of Ahmad's house.\n\nThe person said Ahmad had found RSF fighters in his home. The situation escalated, they killed him, looted the place, and left.\n\nNeighbours wrapped Ahmad in plastic bags until aid workers were able to arrive. They wanted to bury him right there because there's no garden, but the family refused to have him laid to rest virtually in the street. So his body still lies there, encased in the plastic.\n\nAzhaar is still trying to arrange for someone to pick up her grandmother's remains. An organisation that tried on the day the Jeddah Declaration was announced had to turn back because they got caught in a gunfight.\n\n\"I was very close to my grandmother,\" she says. \"And in our last conversation before I left for New York she said, I'm scared you're going to leave me alone.\"\n\n\"I laughed at her.

Nothing more.\"\n\nMr Hancock argued the public inquiry into the pandemic was the right place for analysis of what went on - saying he would reply to the \"substance\" of allegations at the inquiry.\n\nHe apologised to those whose messages had been published by the Daily Telegraph, saying: \"I am also sorry for the impact on the very many people - political colleagues, civil servants and friends - who worked hard with me to get through the pandemic and save lives.\"\n\n\"Isabel and I had worked closely together for more than a year on my book, based on legal confidentiality and a process approved by the Cabinet Office. Isabel repeatedly reiterated the importance of trust throughout, and then broke that trust.\"\n\nA collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph. Here are our stories on the leaks:\n\nThe text messages were passed to the newspaper by Ms Oakeshott, TalkTV's international editor, who has been critical of lockdowns. She was given copies of the texts while helping Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.\n\nThe BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.\n\nMs Oakeshott has strongly defended her decision to release the messages saying she was someone \"acting in the overwhelming national interest\". She has not revealed how much she has been paid by the Telegraph.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks I did this for money must be utterly insane,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.\n\n\"This is about the millions of people, every one of us in this country, that were adversely affected by the catastrophic decision to lockdown the country repeatedly on the flimsiest of evidence, often for the political reasons.\n\n\"I wanted to get to the truth of it,\" she said.\n\nAsked when she told Mr Hancock she would share the messages, she replied: \"I didn't tell him.\"\n\n\"Not one journalist worth their salt would sit on a cache of information in such an important matter, such a historic matter and cover that up,\" she said.\n\nPressed on the claim that Mr Hancock sent her a menacing message following the leaks, Ms Oakeshott said: \"I'm saying that he sent me a message at 01.20 in the morning. It wasn't a pleasant message.\"\n\nMs Oakeshott had initially told broadcasters she had signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Mr Hancock during the writing of her book.\n\nHowever, she later told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that there was not an NDA but rather a \"really standard terms of agreement between us\".\n\nResponding to Mr Hancock's strong criticism, Ms Oakeshott said: \"This isn't about embarrassing individuals or making individual politicians look bad.\n\n\"It's so much bigger than that, it is about the entire country. And if we're going to talk about betrayal, then the way I see it is the betrayal of every one of us, who were let down by the response to the pandemic.\"\n\nAsked if she was worried other politicians would stop trusting her with information, she said \"No, because I'm really good at what I do.

where Mr Gates still serves as an advisor.\n\nBut it is not the only AI-powered chatbot available, with Google recently introducing rival Bard.\n\nI was one of the first people to get access to Bard and my colleagues and I are trying to put it through its paces.\n\nSo far it's given me a philosophical answer to the meaning of life.\n\nIt gave a competent potted history of Russia-China relations to a colleague covering the meeting between President Putin and Xi Jinping - unlike ChatGPT, Bard can access current affairs.\n\nA programme editor asked it for a good running order for her news show. Start with the biggest story of the day, Bard suggested, and end with a musician or comedian. It also did a decent if generic job of a poem about trees and blossom.\n\nI haven't yet started trying to get it to be rude to me, or about others. I'll report back on that\u2026\n\nYou can read more about it here.\n\nMr Gates said he had been meeting with OpenAI - the team behind the artificial intelligence that powers chatbot ChatGPT - since 2016.\n\nIn his blog, Mr Gates said he challenged the OpenAI team in 2022 to train an AI that can pass an Advanced Placement (AP) Biology exam - roughly equivalent to an A-level exam - with the strict rule that the AI could not be specifically trained to answer Biology questions.\n\nA few months later they revealed the results - a near perfect score, he said, missing only one mark out of 50.\n\nAfter the exam, Mr Gates said he asked the AI to write a response to a father with a sick child.\n\n\"It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface (GUI).\"\n\nA GUI is a visual display - allowing a person to interact with images and icons, rather than a display that shows only text and requires typed commands.\n\nIts development led to the Windows and Mac OS operating systems in the 1980s, and remains a key part of computing.\n\nAnd Mr Gates says he believes AI tech will lead to similar advancements.\n\nMr Gates, who co-chairs the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, called on governments to work with industry to \"limit the risks\" of AI, but said the technology could be used to save lives.\n\n\"AI-driven improvements will be especially important for poor countries, where the vast majority of under-5 deaths happen,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive.\"\n\nSome examples of this he gave include completing repetitive tasks such as insurance claims, paperwork, and note-taking.\n\nBut in order for this to happen, Mr Gates called on a targeted approach to AI technology in the future.\n\n\"Market forces won't naturally produce AI products and service that help the poorest,\" he said. \"The opposite is more likely.\n\n\"With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity.\n\n\"Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world's best AIs on its biggest problems.\"The video showed the pair revealing Just Stop Oil T-shirts before being confronted by security staff.\n\nTwo climate change activists have been arrested after attempting to stage a protest at a dinosaur exhibit.\n\nThey entered Herbert Art Gallery and Museum's Dippy the Diplodocus display in Coventry at 10:00 BST on Monday.\n\nA video released by campaign group Just Stop Oil (JSO) showed them being tackled by security staff and led away.\n\nWest Midlands Police said two people were held on susp", "\nHis new show will feature a record and album of the week and performances from the Radio 2 Piano Room.\n\nAsked what he will bring to the show, Kay said: \"Nothing that they haven't heard before really, just tales of the past and everything that has gone on from when I was a caretaker in Bolton.\n\n\"All those stories that connect me with the audience, it's not all champagne, bubbles, tuxedo and dinner parties once you get into showbiz.\"The team will be trying to understand why some buildings survived but others collapsed\n\nStructural and civil engineers from the UK have travelled to Turkey to help to investigate the damage caused by last month's powerful earthquake.\n\nThey are collecting geological data and carrying out detailed assessments of why so many buildings collapsed.\n\nWork with their Turkish colleagues has revealed examples of poor construction, including large pebbles mixed in concrete, which weakens its strength.\n\nBut the sheer power of the quake also caused some of the devastation.\n\nThe ground movement was so great in some areas that it exceeded what buildings had been designed to withstand.\n\nTurkey is also carrying out its own extensive investigations into the quake.\n\nSamples from fallen buildings show that large pebbles have been mixed into concrete\n\nThe research is being carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT).\n\nThe group includes experts from industry as well as leading academics and has carried out assessments of major earthquakes over the last three decades.\n\nThey will combine their findings with research being carried out by Turkish teams and other structural engineers with the aim of learning lessons from the earthquake and finding ways to improve the construction of buildings to make them more resilient.\n\n\"It's important to get the full picture rather than just looking at a snapshot of a single asset or a single building,\" explains Professor Emily So, director of the Cambridge University Centre for Risk in the Built Environment, who is co-leader of the investigation.\n\n\"The successes of the buildings that are still intact and perform perfectly well are as important as the neighbouring buildings that have collapsed.\n\n\"And actually having that distribution, having that overview, is really key to what we can learn from this earthquake.\"\n\nEmily So (pictured) is leading the EEFIT investigation with Yasemin Didem Aktas from UCL\n\nThe Magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck on 6 February in southern Turkey close to the Syrian border and was followed by powerful aftershocks.\n\nMore than 50,000 people lost their lives in the region as buildings collapsed.\n\nIn the wake of the devastation, there has been scrutiny of building regulations and construction practices in Turkey. Now the EEFIT team is carrying out technical evaluations of the performance of buildings in the area.\n\nStructural engineers from Turkey, who are working with the team, have already found some problems.\n\nSamples of concrete taken from a collapsed building in Adiyaman have revealed that it contains 6cm-long stones. They have come from a nearby river and have been used to bulk out the concrete.\n\n\"That has some serious implications on the strength of the concrete,\" says Prof So.\n\nSteel reinforcements were smooth not ridged, which weakens the concrete\n\nAnd steel bars inside the concrete, which should reinforce it, have been found to be smooth instead of ridged.\n\nThis means the concrete doesn't cling to them, again weakening the structure.\n\nIn Turkey, many older buildings collapsed during the quake, but some modern ones also failed.\n\nNew building codes were brought in after a major earthquake in Iznit in 1999, and Prof So says newer buildings should have fared better.\n\n\"I think it's really important that we recognise those and actually do the testing, to find out why these new buildings, which would have been built to code, have failed in such a way,\" she told BBC News.\n\nThe EEFIT team is also analysing the nature of the quake.\n\nDr Yasemin Didem Aktas, co-leader of the expedition, from UCL in London, said that the earthquake was extremely powerful.\n\n\"Even the aftershocks were as large in magnitude as a decent-sized earthquake,\" she said.\n\n\"In an earthquake, the ground shakes in a horizontal and vertical fashion. Often the vertical component is much lower and negligible compared to the horizontal movement. However, this event recorded very high vertical accelerations as well.\"\n\nSome areas saw a process called liquefaction. It turns the solid ground into a heavy fluid - like very wet sand - a tell-tale sign of this is a building that has toppled over or has sunk.\n\n\"I think the characteristics of the events also played a very important role in the devastation that we are seeing,\" Dr Aktas added.\n\nZiggy Lubkowski tells the BBC how buildings can be constructed to withstand earthquakes\n\nBut buildings can be designed to be earthquake resilient.\n\nZiggy Lubkowski, who leads the seismic team at design and engineering company Arup, which has sent engineers to Turkey for the investigation, said: \"What we try and do when we design buildings is to prevent life loss.\n\n\"The basic design principle is to allow some form of damage within the building. That damage absorbs the energy of the earthquake, and ensures that the building still stays upright, but doesn't collapse.\"\n\nComponents such as dampers, which act like shock absorbers as the building sways to and fro, and rubber bearings, which are fitted underneath a building and absorb the energy of a quake, can be added.\n\nBut all of this costs money.\n\nRebuilding in the area will cost more than $100bn the UN says\n\n\"Those increases, in terms of the structural cost of the building, may be in the order of 10 to 15%, depending on the nature of the building,\" Ziggy Lubkowski says.\n\n\"But actually, if you think about it, the fit-out costs of a building often outweigh the structural costs of a building. So at the end of the day, the additional structural costs are not that much more.\"\n\nThe United Nations has estimated that the cost of clearing and rebuilding in the earthquake in Turkey could exceed $100 billion.\n\nThe EEFIT team says the findings, which will be published in the coming weeks, could help in setting new building codes to stop the devastation caused by this earthquake from happening again,\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.A drink-driver has admitted killing charity cyclist Tony Parsons and burying his body to cover up the crime.\n\nAlexander McKellar, 31, was speeding and had been drinking when he caused Mr Parsons' death.\n\nHe and twin brother Robert McKellar admitted trying to defeat the ends of justice by hiding the body in a grave in the Auch Estate near Bridge of Orchy in September 2017.\n\nMr Parsons' remains were not found until January 2021.\n\nHis family said it had been \"heartbreaking\" to live with so many unanswered questions over the six years since he went missing.\n\nAlexander McKellar (L) and twin brother Robert appeared at the High Court in Glasgow\n\nThe High Court in Glasgow heard how Alexander McKellar collided with Mr Parsons on the A82 between Bridge of Orchy and Tyndrum on 29 September 2017.\n\nMcKellar did not seek medical assistance for the 63-year-old at the roadside.\n\nThe damaged car involved in the killing was dumped at the nearby Auch Estate along with the brothers' phones.\n\nThey then returned in a truck to where Mr Parsons was still lying.\n\nHe was placed into the vehicle along with his bike and other personal belongings.\n\nThe brothers went back to the Auch Estate and initially hid Mr Parsons' body in a part of the woods.\n\nHe was later taken to another location used for \"the purposes of disposing dead animals\".\n\nThe brothers then dug a grave and buried Mr Parsons along with his personal possessions.\n\nProsecutors said the brothers got help trying to repair the car used in the killing, claiming it had been damaged when it hit a deer.\n\nTony Parsons was last seen outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel in September 2017\n\nThe two men had been due to stand trial accused of Mr Parsons' murder.\n\nBut Alexander McKellar pled guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.\n\nHis brother had his not guilty plea to murder accepted.\n\nThe pair both admitted attempting to defeat", "campaign in London last summer reached more than 370,000 children.\n\nAnd in early November, the latest tests found less of the virus - but officials say there is no room for complacency.\n\nDr Vanessa Saliba, from the UK Heath Security Agency, told BBC News: \"We have early signs that there's less spread of poliovirus in London - but we will need 12 months of no detections before the World Health Organization could declare that the UK is no longer an infected country.\"\n\nPolio causes paralysis in a very small number of cases where the virus attacks the nerves in the spine and base of the brain - but most are asymptomatic.\n\nLast month, an eight-year-old in northern Israel was paralysed in an outbreak that saw three other children infected.

'Are you a nightmare to work for?' Raab asked by BBC\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has accused \"activist civil servants\" of trying to block the work of government, after his dramatic resignation over bullying claims.\n\nAn inquiry found he was \"intimidating\" and \"aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he was sorry if he upset anyone but \"that's not bullying\".\n\nHe said there was a risk \"a very small minority\" of officials \"with a passive aggressive culture\" were trying to block reforms they did not like.\n\nIn his first interview since stepping down, Mr Raab told the BBC the only complaints upheld against him were by \"a handful of very senior officials\", out of hundreds of civil servants he had dealt with.\n\nAsked if the blunt truth was that he was a nightmare to work for, the former justice secretary said: \"Well actually, almost all of the complaints against me were dismissed.\"\n\nHe said a \"very small minority of very activist civil servants\" were effectively trying to block reforms they did not like, related to areas including Brexit, prisoner parole and human rights.\n\n\"That's not on. That's not democratic,\" the MP for Esher and Walton added.\n\n\"If you've got particularly activist civil servants, who either because they're over-unionised or just don't agree with what we're trying to pursue... If actually, they block reforms or changes through a rather passive aggressive approach, we can't deliver for the British people,\" he said.\n\nAsked if there were people standing in the way of an elected government, Mr Raab said: \"I was told that by one cabinet secretary, and by one director of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch Raab's first interview since quitting over bullying\n\nHowever, the FDA union, which represents civil servants, accused Mr Raab of peddling \"dangerous conspiracy theories that undermine the impartiality and integrity of the civil service\" to \"deflect from an independent investigation's criticism of his conduct\".\n\nThe head of the union, Dave Penman, said the prime minister had a duty to defend the impartiality of the civil service and \"stop giving his former ally a free hand\".\n\nOne former senior civil servant who worked closely with Mr Raab told BBC Newsnight he \"has often publicly praised the work of his civil servants\" and his latest comments seemed to be \"at odds\" with this.\n\nAnother said: \"In my experience, most civil servants do their jobs because they want to deliver for the public.\n\n\"They do this through a long-standing and normally very effective relationship with the democratically elected ministers.\n\n\"I think you'd struggle to find a similar example of the disfunction we've heard about in Tolley's report so it's perhaps fair to draw the conclusion that there is one common thread to this unique situation and that's Raab.\"\n\nThe inquiry by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC looked at eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour during his previous stints as justice secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.\n\nHis report concluded Mr Raab's conduct involved \"an abuse or misuse of power\", and that he \"acted in a manner which was intimidating\" and \"persistently aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nMr Raab, a close ally of the prime minister, had pledged to resign if the investigation made any finding of bullying against him.\n\nIn his resignation letter, he said he accepted the inquiry's findings but described them as \"flawed\".\n\nAsked in his BBC interview if he wanted to apologise, Mr Raab said: \"If someone had hurt feelings, because of something I did, of course, I want an empowered team.\n\n\"The vast majority of the civil servants who worked for me were brilliant, fantastic and actually relished the energy, the challenge, the drive that I believe I brought.\n\n\"But of course, I don't want to upset anyone and I made clear that I'm sorry for that. But that's not bullying, and we can't deliver for the British people if the bar is that low.\"\n\nHe added: \"If it's not intentional, if it's not personalised, if actually it is right, but there are some subjective hurt feelings by some, I'm afraid that makes it very difficult to deliver.\"\n\nMr Raab said the findings of the inquiry set \"a very dangerous precedent\".\n\n\"If the bar, the threshold for bullying is lowered that low, it's almost impossible for ministers to deliver for the British people and I think it'll have a chilling effect on effective government, and the British people will pay a price,\" he said.\n\nHe added that a lot of ministers were now \"very fearful that the direct challenge that they bring fairly, squarely in government, may leave them at risk of the same treatment that I've had\".\n\nAsked if he would fight the next general election as a Conservative candidate in Esher and Walton, where he has slim majority of less than 3,000 votes, Mr Raab said he wanted to \"let the dust settle\" but ultimately it was a decision for his local constituency association.\n\nConservative peer Lord Marland said Mr Raab's resignation was \"almost a conspiracy by the civil service\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newsnight, he said it was \"a very black day for all employers\" because a \"dangerous precedent has been set\" [on the issue of workplace bullying] that would \"send shudders through all employers in the country\".\n\nHowever, Lord Vaizey told the same programme: \"I don't believe for a minute\u2026 that any civil servant would actively seek to undermine what you're doing.\"\n\nHe said there was a \"clash of cultures\" between often impatient ministers and a civil service who do things \"properly\" which leads to \"tension\".\n\nHannah White, director of the Institute for Government think tank, said \"no civil servant would feel encouraged to speak out in future\" after the responses of Mr Sunak and Mr Raab to the Tolley report.\n\nShe said Mr Sunak had missed an opportunity to reinforce standards and \"the mutual suspicion which has been growing between ministers and civil servants remains and nothing has been done to reduce the risk of future problems.\"\n\nForm", "ender Identity Development Service (Gids), based at London's Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, was rated as \"inadequate\" by inspectors, who visited in late 2020. It was earmarked for closure in July 2022.\n\nAn independent review, led by Dr Hilary Cass, also called for a \"fundamentally different\" model of care for children with gender dysphoria.\n\nProf Butler has been awarded a key role in shaping the new service, as one of several people tasked with implementing a new training programme, underpinned by Dr Cass's recommendations.\n\nHowever, BBC Newsnight has learned Prof Butler - the current service's most senior doctor - has publicly questioned the need for change and described Dr Cass's recommendations as \"slightly unusual\".\n\nIn the 14-minute speech at the conference, he talked about current services across the UK, the legal challenges to the situation in England, and how he felt Gids has been the subject of \"lies\" in the media.\n\nThe consultant paediatric endocrinologist at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) told the conference of hundreds of transgender healthcare professionals how the Cass Review had highlighted the need to provide \"developmentally appropriate healthcare for children and young people\".\n\n\"But what on earth are we doing now?\" he told the European Professional Association for Transgender Health conference, which was held in Ireland, last month. \"It's exactly what we're doing at the present time, and what the Gids is doing.\"\n\nSpeaking about the new proposals, he said instead of expanding gender care, \"they've almost contracted it\".\n\nIn the recording, which was then handed to Newsnight, he was also heard questioning the personal integrity of Dr Cass. He implied there had been, what he referred to as, nepotism around the choice of two hospitals in the south of England as the sites for new clinics - suggesting Dr Cass's previous involvement in them both had been a factor.\n\nThe review led by Dr Hilary Cass was initially commissioned in 2020\n\nNHS England says the two new regional hubs, which will replace Gids, are taking longer than anticipated to set up. They are intended to offer a clean break from the past.\n\nBut referring to the hospitals, which will form these new hubs, Prof Butler appeared to question the need for a more diverse workforce, telling the conference that none of the staff had \"any experience of management of gender incongruence in young people\". He added: \"It's shocking.\"\n\nIn his role at UCLH, Prof Butler is responsible for prescribing medication including puberty blockers and hormones to young people who have been assessed by Gids as suitable for such treatments.\n\nGids will now remain open until at least March 2024. Meanwhile, there are more than 8,000 young people currently waiting for care.\n\nIn a statement, Prof Butler said Newsnight's reporting of his comments were \"highly selective\" and that his views were made as part of a wider presentation on gender identity services in the UK. \"I wish to make clear that I fully support Dr Hilary Cass's recommendations to develop new services for young people experiencing gender dysphoria,\" he added.\n\nThe Cass Review team said, while it accepts that people hold different views on how services should develop, there was \"general consensus that the current model, within a single specialist gender service, cannot provide timely, holistic care for the mix of children and young people seeking support\".\n\nIt said Dr Cass did not select which hospitals would form the new regional centres, saying accusations to the contrary were \"baseless\".\n\nEm: 'They push the drugs on you so early on'\n\nWhile Gids has helped some young people, critics - including young trans people seen by the clinic - claim it was sometimes too quick to refer young people for medical interventions and it could overlook mental health difficulties.\n\n\"They push the drugs on you so early on,\" Em, a 19-year-old trans man, who has identified as male since early childhood, told Newsnight. Em says he was offered medication during his second appointment, adding: \"I was 11.\"\n\nAfter five appointments, Gids referred Em to UCLH for puberty blockers. These were prescribed by Prof Butler when Em was 12. He stayed on them for nearly four years.\n\nWhile the blockers slowed Em's puberty, they didn't stop it. He was put on higher doses and, when that did not work, he was administered beta blockers. Em later collapsed at school.\n\n\"To me that was dangerous\", Em's mother told Newsnight. Em suffered violent mood swings and gained lots of weight while on the blockers.\n\nHe stopped taking puberty blockers in 2019 and hasn't chosen to take hormones to masculinise his body. Since being discharged in 2020, neither Gids nor UCLH has been in touch with Em.\n\n\"I feel completely forgotten about,\" he says now. \"I still don't know what is happening with my body [or] what the blockers did.\"\n\nThe NHS says little is known about the long-term side effects of puberty blockers in children with gender dysphoria. Dr Cass has insisted there needs to be more research.\n\nBoth the NHS and Dr Cass have made it clear that staff at the new gender identity services for children must have wider experience of working with young people - including expertise in autism, mental health and safeguarding.\n\nEm says the new services must be different. \"The new system needs to be a mental health service,\" he says, and offer more holistic care for trans people. \"For them, you weren't transgender unless you're willing to go the full way [in medically transitioning]. I was a child. I did not know what I was doing.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said it had reviewed Newsnight's claims, adding that they \"do not align with the evidence we have\", though it declined to give specifics about that evidence.\n\nIt said it works on a case-by-case basis with every young person, their family and local services, but said it was inappropriate to comment on Em's individual patient care.\n\n\"Patients who begin medical treatment do so only after they've been fully assessed (including mental health), and only if the parent/carer is supportive,\" the trust added.\n\nA UCLH spokesman also said it would be inappropriate to comment on an individual patient's care, but added that Gids clinicians \"discuss non-medical interventions with patients before and after referral to our endocrinology clinic\".\n\n\"Patients only begin medical treatment if they are assessed as having full competence to consent and there is parental support,\" UCLH said, adding that the clinic follows the service specification set out by NHS England.\n\nNHS England, which commissions children's gender identity services, said all aspects of the new service would be guided by the ongoing findings and expert advice from the Cass Review.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care agreed, adding that an oversight group will ensure training is in line with the new clinical approach.Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve have been targeted with conspiracy theories\n\nManchester Arena bomb survivors have filed landmark legal action against a conspiracy theorist who claims the attack was faked.\n\nMartin and Eve Hibbert, who were left with severe disabilities after the 2017 blast, are suing Richard D Hall for defamation and harassment.\n\nIt is the first time such action has been launched in the UK against a conspiracy theorist.\n\nMr Hall did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nMartin Hibbert was paralysed from the waist down and his daughter Eve left severely disabled by the Manchester Arena blast which killed 22 people in 2017.\n\nLast October, a Radio 4 podcast series and BBC Panorama investigation revealed they are among victims targeted by conspiracy theorist Richard D Hall, who has described online how he tracks down survivors to their homes and workplaces to see if they are lying about their injuries.\n\nMr Hall admitted to the BBC that he spied on Miss Hibbert from a vehicle parked outside her home.\n\nHe has also described his tactics in a book he sells, and has promoted theories online that several other UK terror attacks were staged.\n\nNow, the family is seeking an injunction to restrain Mr Hall from making similar allegations in future and damages for some of the harm he has caused them.\n\nThe case echoes the action against US conspiracist Alex Jones,", "1m in less than 24 hours - smashing James initial goal for the fund of \u00a3250,000.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, James said the news had made her feel \"utterly loved\", adding: \"It makes me feel like we're all kind of in it at the end together and we all want to make a difference.\"\n\nShe also said that her dying wish was to help raise money for the \"things that gave me life\", explaining that were it not for experimental treatments she would have died at least two years ago\n\n\"Ultimately what I really want to happen is I don't want any other Deborahs to have to go through this,\" James said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

We went to the premises last week and made three arrests and seized millions more documents,\" Ms Miles said.\n\nShe said it fell to local authorities to regulate meat processors and that the FSA was the \"last line of defence for particularly serious allegations\".\n\n\"What's meant to happen is that retailers and manufacturers, who are responsible for ensuring food is safe, have to be vigilant and do their own audits and sampling.\n\n\"The FSA is not on the ground the whole time at all, in fact we act on intelligence. As soon as we got intelligence, we acted,\" Ms Miles said.\n\nHowever, the FSA chief said her department only had 27 staff running \"about eight live investigations\".\n\n\"We can only go as fast as we can with that resource. For this particular investigation, we were reviewing six million documents, we've now added a lot more.\"\n\nFarmers Weekly, which said multiple sources had said it was common to mix rotting pork with fresh goods for further processing, also reported claims that meat was \"sometimes thawed out on the factory floor\".\n\nDeputy editor Abi Kay told Today: \"Most concerningly, two employees said the paperwork which would pick up bacteria like listeria and e-coli, was falsified.\n\n\"That is no joke, listeria and e-coli can kill people.\"\n\nMs Kay also explained how the alleged fraud worked by buying a \"relatively small volume of British meat\" from an approved supplier.\n\n\"Then they would use the traceability information from this delivery for all the products it made in that week with the majority coming in", "\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has signalled the government wants to end the practice of housing migrants in hotels, which she says costs around \u00a36m a day.\n\nFormer airbases in Lincolnshire and Essex are among sites being looked at.\n\nPrivate hotels are currently used to house asylum seekers as part of the government's legal obligation to provide people seeking help with a basic level of accommodation.\n\nThe government says private accommodation options are at maximum capacity and argue they do not represent good value for money for the taxpayer.\n\nIt has made reducing illegal migration a key priority and has unveiled measures it says will deter people crossing the English Channel in small boats.\n\nMore than 45,000 reached the UK via the dangerous route last year, up from around 300 in 2018.\n\nThe government's Illegal Migration Bill would ban anyone who enters the country illegally from claiming asylum on arrival - or in the future.\n\nIt would also create an annual cap on the number of refugees the UK will settle through \"safe and legal routes\", and impose a legal duty on the Home Secretary to swiftly detain and remove anyone who arrives illegally.\n\nThe government's policy to deport migrants to Rwanda has been ruled to be legal by the High Court, but is facing further challenges in the courts.\n\nThe home secretary has said there is no limit to how many migrants Rwanda would be able to take - however no flights have taken off.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have always been upfront about the unprecedented pressure being placed on our asylum system, brought about by a significant increase in dangerous and illegal journeys into the country.

I hand the bottle back - very carefully.\n\nThe bottle, designed for a rare whisky, is one of the creations of Stoelzle Flaconnage, based in Knottingley, West Yorkshire. Glassware has been made on this site since 1871.\n\nIn 1994 the factory was taken over by Austria's Stoelzle Glass Group, which has focused the plant on making bottles for the spirits industry.\n\nIt can handle the design, bottle making and decoration all on one site.\n\nDemand is strong, helped by the boom in gin making and demand for whisky in Asia. When I visit, the plant is busy, lumps of molten glass are dropping into dozens of moulds, the glass still glowing orange from the heat of the furnace.\n\nTo stand out in a crowded market, customers want distinctive bottles, with patterned and sometimes coloured glass, elaborate labels and artwork.\n\n\"What our clients are looking for is to have their product presented in an outstanding - sometimes iconic - way,\" says Thomas Riss, chief executive of Stoelzle Flaconnage.\n\nTo make glass the raw materials have to be heated up to 1,500C\n\nWhile business is brisk, Stoelzle Flaconnage - and other glassmakers - are having to make some big decisions about the way they make glass containers.\n\nThe European Union is cracking down on packaging waste. It wants packaging to be lighter so less material is needed and less fuel is needed for transportation.\n\nIt has been working on the Packaging & Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), which is in the final stages of approval.\n\nUnder the rules, member states would have to cut back on packaging weight and would have to introduce measures to meet targets.\n\nThere is concern in the glass container industry that it will be unfairly targeted as glass is relatively heavy, compared with plastic or aluminium.\n\n\"Light doesn't mean sustainable,\" points out Vanessa Chesnot, from FEVE, the industry body which represents European glass container makers.\n\n\"Glass is 100% and infinitely recyclable... so, you can recycle a whisky bottle into another bottle, forever basically.\"\n\nWhile it's true that glass recycling is an established process, making glass, even using recycled materials, is energy intensive.\n\nMost glass making involves burning natural gas to heat the raw materials in a furnace to 1,500C. Burning gas and heating the raw materials both produce CO2.\n\nThomas Riss plans to open an electric furnace in 2026 at the Stoelzle plant in Knottingley\n\nThe furnace I saw in action at Stoelzle Flaconnage uses about 191,000 kWh of energy per day - that's enough to supply the average UK household with energy for 12 years.\n\nIt is considered a relatively small furnace; bigger plants would have furnaces twice the size.\n\nWhat's more, glass furnaces are never turned off, as it takes 12 days for a furnace to reach its operating temperature. Essentially a furnace will run all day, every day for its operational life - typically between ten and 12 years.\n\nSo the glass industry is looking at switching from gas-fired furnaces to electricity.\n\nIf the electricity comes from a sustainable source then the carbon footprint is slashed, which could go a long way to helping glass firms meet their goal to become net zero by 2050.\n\nUntil recent years, running a furnace on electricity was considered too expensive. But electricity prices have become more competitive, so glass makers are looking at making the switch.\n\nStoelzle Flaconnage, plans to have an electric furnace running in Knottingley by 2026.\n\n\"When I talked with my engineers, five years back, none of them would have ever come up with the idea of electric furnaces, because the mathematics didn't make sense. But this has changed now,\" says Mr Riss.\n\nHowever, electric furnaces might not be an option for companies that mass produce containers, like beer bottles. Even if electric furnaces can be made big enough, the extra expense of electricity will be off-putting for them.\n\n\"For the time being it [electric furnace tech] is mainly being developed for niche markets or small furnaces producing high added value products,\" says FEVE's director of environment, health and safety, Fabrice Rivet.\n\nAn extra challenge for electric glass furnaces is plugging them in. Connections to the electricity grid often have to be upgraded, to cope with the extra electricity supply.\n\nBut the glass industry is attempting to clear some of those hurdles.\n\nArdagh Glass Packaging is making glass with Europe's first hybrid furnace\n\nIn Obernkirchen, in northern Germany the world's most advanced hybrid glass furnace is undergoing trials, at Ardagh Glass Packaging (AGP).\n\nPartly funded by the German government and the EU, and made by Germany company Sorg, it is a large furnace with a capacity of 350 tonnes - enough to make about a million beer bottles a day.\n\nWhen fully operational it will run on 80% sustainable electricity and 20% gas, which AGP says will save 45,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nEngineers at AGP are giving the furnace the ultimate test - making amber-coloured glass, which involves tricky chemistry and is more difficult to control than making clear glass.\n\n\"There has been no successful demonstration of full-scale amber glass production in full electric melting. And if you wanted to combine the maximum of carbon footprint reduction with high cullet (recycled glass) and amber glass, then the hybrid is the logical choice,\" says Joris Goossens, research and development project manager at AGP.\n\nAGP says that once the hybrid furnace has proved itself, then the next step could be replacing the natural gas with hydrogen.\n\nEven if the industry does make the switch to electric or hybrid furnaces, it still has other problems to solve.\n\nThe raw materials needed to make glass, including sand, soda ash and limestone, emit CO2 while they are being heated. They account for about 20% of the carbon emissions of the glass making process.\n\nThe industry hopes that using more recycled glass in the production process will cut those emissions, but getting enough unwanted glass is a challenge.\n\nOne academic who has studied", "cisive action\" against Margaret Ferrier at the time, which he supported.\n\nHe added: \"We want there to be a by-election.

The same month last year saw 8,631 arrivals in small boats, the highest number since records began.\n\nOf the 45,755 people detected arriving by small boats in 2022, 51% of these people arrived between August and October.\n\nThe government says it wants to reduce the cost of housing asylum seekers as there are currently about 51,000 in hotels across the UK, costing the taxpayer about \u00a36m a day.\n\n\"We continue to work across government and with local authorities to look at a range of accommodation options,\" a Home Office spokesperson said.\n\n\"Accommodation offered to asylum seekers, on a no choice basis, meets our legal and contractual requirements.\"\n\nThere are plans to house hundreds of migrants on a barge in Portland, Dorset\n\nMeanwhile, the Home Office expects to send an initial 50 people to the UK's first floating barge for asylum seekers in the coming days.\n\nA government source confirmed the Home Office intended to send the group to board the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, on Tuesday.\n\nThe move is going ahead despite protests about the barge, which is designed to reduce the use of hotels for people waiting on asylum claims.\n\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \"The Bibby Stockholm has completed a statutory inspection and refurbishment and is now berthing in Portland.\n\n\"The welfare of those in our care is of the utmost priority and the barge is now undergoing final preparations to ensure it complies with all appropriate regulations before the arrival of the first asylum seekers in the coming weeks.\"\n\nBut plans to move 2,000 migrants to a former RAF base in Scampton, Lincolnshire, from August, have been delayed until October at the earliest, according to Scampton Parish Council.\n\nIt said the Home Office had told the council work had still to be completed on the buildings that would house the migrants.\n\nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.MPs investigating whether Boris Johnson misled Parliament over Partygate will publish their long-awaited report on Thursday.\n\nMr Johnson quit as an MP after receiving an advance copy of the report - which he said had found him guilty \"regardless of the facts\".\n\nThe report follows a year-long inquiry by the Privileges Committee.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Johnson called for a committee member to resign over claims the MP had breached Covid restrictions.\n\nThe Guido Fawkes website alleged that Sir Bernard Jenkin, a senior Conservative MP on the committee, attended a drinks party for his wife's birthday in the House of Commons in December 2020. At the time social mixing outside of households or support bubbles was banned in London.\n\nHaving contacted several people involved in the allegations, the BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims. Sir Bernard, Lady Jenkin and the alleged host of the gathering have been approached for comment.\n\nSir Bernard originally denied attending any drinks parties during lockdown. When he was asked by a Guido Fawkes reporter whether he had a drink at the celebration of his wife's birthday that evening, Sir Bernard is quoted as saying \"I don't recall\".\n\nDame Eleanor Laing, the Deputy Speaker, who allegedly hosted the party, told the website: \"I took advice on how many could be present in a room, I had the room measured and I kept a two-metre ruler so that I could always verify that nobody who was working here was put at risk.\"\n\nMr Johnson has written to Labour's Harriet Harman, who has chaired the inquiry, demanding she clarify whether she checked that panel members had not attended such events before the inquiry began.\n\nIf the reports were true, Sir Bernard was \"guilty of flagrant and monstrous hypocrisy\", Mr Johnson said.\n\nLast week, the former prime minister branded the committee a \"kangaroo court\" whose purpose \"has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts\".\n\nMr Johnson accused the committee of mounting a \"witch hunt\" against him, and Ms Harman, of showing \"egregious bias\".\n\nThe committee said it had \"followed the procedures\" at all times and accused Mr Johnson of impugning \"the integrity of the House by his statement\".\n\nAt 23:57 BST on Monday, Mr Johnson sent a last-minute letter to the committee in response to their findings.\n\nUnder the published process, Mr Johnson was entitled to respond to the committee up to 14 days after receiving its draft findings, which were sent last week.\n\nThe committee said it would deal with the new developments and \"report promptly\".\n\nFor almost a year, the seven-person committee - a majority of whom are Conservatives - have been considering whether Mr Johnson misled MPs about Covid-19 breaches in Downing Street and what he knew about them.\n\nGiving evidence in March, Mr Johnson admitted misleading Parliament, but denied doing it on purpose.\n\nHe said social distancing had not been \"perfect\" at gatherings in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns, but insisted the guidelines, as he understood them, were followed at all times.\n\nThe Partygate scandal dogged Mr Johnson's premiership, with", "not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Workers clear the wreckage from the train tracks following the fatal train accident on Friday\n\nIndia's railway minister has suggested a signal fault led to the Odisha rail disaster, with a \"change in electronic interlocking\" the likely cause.\n\nAshwini Vaishnaw later said the cause and people responsible for the deadly three-train crash in eastern India had been identified but did not elaborate.\n\nIndia's Railway Board said there had been \"some kind of signalling interference\" rather than failure.\n\nA report into India's worst rail accident this century is due later.\n\nMeanwhile the death toll has been revised down to 275 after some bodies were counted twice, officials said.\n\nOf the 1,175 injured people taken to hospital, 793 have been discharged. Some families are still searching for their loved ones.\n\nIn railway signalling the electronic interlocking system sets routes for each train in a set area, ensuring the safe movement of trains along the track.\n\nThe crash saw a passenger train collide with a stationary goods train and derail, after being wrongly directed onto a loop track by the side of the main line. Derailed carriages then struck the rear carriages of a second passenger train passing in the opposite direction.\n\nAt a press conference on Sunday, Jaya Verma Sinha from India's Railway Board said both passenger trains had approached a Balasore district station under a green signal - indicating it was safe - within seconds of each other at the correct speed of under 130kph (81mph).\n\nShe said the passenger trains had been supposed to pass each other on the main lines but the Coromandel Express rammed into an iron ore-laden freight train on the loop line, causing the engine and some coaches to lift over the top of the heavy goods carriages.\n\nThe passenger train took the entire impact on collision and the freight train was not derailed, or even moved, she told reporters.\n\nThe Howrah Superfast Express had nearly crossed in the opposite direction, but two of its rear coaches were struck by the derailed Coromandel Express.\n\nMs Verma Sinha said there was \"no issue with the electronic interlocking system\" and said investigations indicated \"some kind of a signalling interference\" rather than failure.\n\n\"Whether it was manual, whether it was incidental, whether it was weather related, whether it was because of wear and tear related, whether it was a maintenance failure, all that will come out after the inquiry,\" she added.\n\nInfrastructure expert Partha Mukhopadhyay told the BBC it should not be possible for green signals to display on the main line if the track is set for the loop.\n\n\"Signal interlocking is supposed to be failsafe and this level of failure is quite unprecedented,\" Mr Mukhopadhyay, from the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research, said.\n\nOn Saturday Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the crash scene and vowed that anyone found guilty would be \"punished stringently\".\n\nAround 2,000 people are thought to have been on board the two passenger trains - the Coromandel Express, travelling between Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) and Chennai (formerly Madras) and the Howrah Superfast Express travelling from Yesvantpur to Howrah - when the crash happened at about at about 19:00 (13:30 GMT) on Friday.\n\nOdisha state official Pradeep Jena told the BBC that at least 187 bodies remained unidentified and officials were uploading pictures of the victims on government websites and would carry out DNA testing if needed.\n\nRescue work was completed on Saturday and efforts were underway to clear wreckage and restart train traffic, officials said.\n\nIndia has one of the largest train networks in the world with millions of passengers using it daily, but a lot of the railway infrastructure needs improving.\n\nTrains in India can get very packed at this time of year, with a growing number of people travelling during school holidays.\n\nThe country's worst train disaster was in 1981, when an overcrowded passenger train was blown off the tracks and into a river during a cyclone in Bihar state, killing about 800 people.Video footage posted online showed Max recoiling after being struck by a concertgoer\n\nSinger Ava Max has said a concertgoer \"slapped me so hard\" during a show in Los Angeles that he \"scratched the inside of my eye\".\n\nVideos shared online appeared to show a man hit the US pop star in the face while she was performing.\n\nThe footage shows Max recoiling and holding her eye after being struck.\n\nFollowing the show, the singer wrote on Twitter: \"He slapped me so hard that he scratched the inside of my eye. He's never coming to a show again.\"\n\nShe added: \"Thank you to the fans for being spectacular tonight in LA though!!\"\n\nThe 29-year-old singer was performing at The Fonda Theatre on Tuesday when she was hit.\n\nIt came days after pop star Bebe Rexha sustained facial injuries after an audience member threw a phone at her while she was on stage in New York.\n\nAva Max rose to fame with Sweet But Psycho and has since had hits with Salt and Kings & Queens\n\nMax had been near the end of her show when she was struck and left the stage soon after. She wore sunglasses during a meet-and-greet with fans following the show.\n\nJoel Rangel, 30, from Tucson, Arizona, who captured the moment on video, told the PA news agency: \"She was ending the show with her song The Motto and a fan just ran and jumped on the left side of the stage.\n\n\"As he jumped on stage some of the lights fell to the floor and he was running for Ava with his arms wide open like he was going to hug her.\n\n\"But the security ran and grabbed him and as they did she just happened to turn and his arm was out and hit her in the face.\"\n\nMr Rangel, who said he flew to Los Angeles for the concert, added: \"Also, they almost cancelled the meet-and-greet because of the situation.\n\n\"She had to wear sunglasses and she was disoriented and dazed so it was sad having to talk to her like that.\"\n\nAnother fan, Cory Larrabee, tweeted: \"The security guard tackled him and literally THREW him down the stairs. Wild!!! It happened so fast.\"\n\nThe singer, whose real name is Amanda Ava Koci, rose to fame following her breakout single Sweet But Psycho in 2018 and has since enjoyed chart success with Kings & Queens, Salt and My Head & My Heart.\n\nHer debut studio album, Heaven & Hell, peaked at number two in the UK in 2020 and she released her second album, Diamonds & Dancefloors, earlier this year.Falling electricity prices have been offset by a reduction in government support\n\nPower NI customers will face a 14% increase in electricity prices from 1 April.\n\nIt is actually reducing its tariffs by 16.2%, but that has been offset by a reduction in government support to customers.\n\nThat support was through the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), which protects customers from price rises by limiting the amount suppliers can charge.\n\nThe government said that means a typical Northern Ireland household using electricity and mains gas will see their energy bill increase from the equivalent of \u00a31,952 a year to \u00a32,109.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Chancellor announced that in Great Britain the EPG will be extended for three months at its current level keeping a typical household bill at the equivalent of \u00a32,500 a year.\n\nHowever, in Northern Ireland the EPG will become less generous from the end of March.\n\nThis is because the scheme was originally introduced later in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, so Northern Ireland customers got an additional backdated discount.\n\nThat extra support will be withdrawn at the end of March.\n\nWilliam Steele, director of customer solutions at Power NI, said any customers worried about paying bills should contact the company directly.\n\nMr Steele said Power NI would \"ensure the most vulnerable in our society and those who are struggling get the help they need\".\n\nPeter McClenaghan, of the Consumer Council, said it was likely the other four unregulated electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland will also increase their prices.\n\n\"Consumers should consider reviewing their tariff in the coming months to ensure they are on the best deal for their needs, as money can be saved by switching supplier,", "\n\nChildren are also given added protections under international humanitarian law.\n\nSixteen-year-old Abdul Rahman was killed at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday, as confrontations had continued in the city. Some involved gunmen firing towards Israeli forces.\n\nOthers involved Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli jeeps and armoured troop carriers - a frequent occurrence as young men try to repel Israel's military raids into Palestinian cities.\n\nIn one video, first verified by the Times newspaper, the teenager can be seen standing in the street next to al-Amal hospital, close to a group of boys or young men. Rocks or other debris appear on the ground in the vicinity. No weapons are visible and Abdul Rahman appears unarmed.\n\nAround 13 seconds into the footage, which has no sound, he leans forward to look down a street next to the hospital. He is then seen falling to the ground, having been shot in the head.\n\nThe original source of the video is not known to the BBC, but the boy's family and the eyewitnesses verified it as showing Abdul Rahman being shot.\n\nA second video shows paramedics and bystanders rushing to Abdul Rahman Hardan's aid moments after was shot\n\nA second video filmed by a journalist outside the hospital shows the following moments, in which a paramedic rushes to Abdul Rahman and picks him up before carrying him along the street. The boy is suffering a catastrophic bleed from the head as he is carried towards the hospital entrance.\n\nNo weapons are visible in the area where the teenager fell nor elsewhere in the footage.\n\nThe IDF said it was inconclusive as to whether the footage documented the killing of Abdul Rahman by its forces.\n\nIslamic Jihad - listed by Israel and the West as a terrorist organisation - claimed the 16-year-old as a fighter. Social media pictures later emerged in which he had posed with assault rifles at unknown dates. Such pictures are not uncommon among young men and teenagers in Jenin and surrounding villages.\n\nThe refugee camp is a highly militarised environment where the official Palestinian leadership has lost control, and armed groups see themselves as a core of resistance to Israel's military occupation - now into its 57th year. Human rights groups have frequently condemned militant groups putting weapons in the hands of minors.\n\nThe teenager's father, Hassan Ahmad Hardan, told the BBC that his son was on his way to the hospital to donate blood when an Israeli military vehicle entered the street.\n\n\"He was standing in the street to cross it when they shot him in the head from the back,\" said Mr Hardan.\n\n\"He did not carry anything with him - no stone, no weapon, nothing,\" he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Times, his family also said Abdul Rahman was not a militant and did not belong to any armed group.\n\nTwo eyewitnesses also told the BBC the teenager was unarmed.\n\n\"We were standing in one of the streets near the presence of occupation [Israeli] forces. After that, the occupation sniper shot the martyr Abdul Rahman without any reason or justification,\" said one eyewitness, who asked that his name was not published.\n\n\"The martyr was unarmed and did not carry anything,\" he added.\n\nOf the 12 Palestinians killed in Jenin last week, two were aged 16 and two were 17 years old. Ten of the total were claimed as members by militant groups.\n\nThe IDF said it continued to examine the video, asking to receive it in its \"unedited entirety\".\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman said: \"As of this time, it is not possible to say with certainty that the video does indeed document the neutralization of Abdul Rahman Hassan by IDF forces.\"\n\nThe spokesman said it was \"unfortunate\" that earlier reports \"discounted the Islamic Jihad's claim of responsibility for the neutralized terrorist and his association with the terrorist organization\".\n\nHe went on: \"The IDF operated in a densely populated and complex combat zone, where hundreds of armed gunmen fired indiscriminately in the area. The IDF does everything in its power to avoid harming uninvolved individuals and operates precisely against terrorist organisations.\"Teachers had been calling for a 10% pay rise this year\n\nScotland's council leaders have agreed to make a new offer to teachers in an attempt to end a dispute over pay.\n\nThe full details have been sent to teaching unions, who will discuss the offer on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe proposal involves a 7% rise backdated to last April, a further 5% this April and another 2% in January.\n\nSchools across Scotland have been closed by a series of strikes during the dispute, with further action planned in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Scottish government has said most teachers would see their salaries rise by \u00a35,200 in April if the new pay offer is accepted.\n\nThe latest strikes targeting the constituencies of some Scottish government ministers, including Nicola Sturgeon, are due to be held next week.\n\nTeachers are also due to hold a 20-day wave of rolling strikes between 13 March and 21 April.\n\nThe new offer follows intensive talks earlier in the week between the EIS union, Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\n\nThe EIS, the country's biggest teaching union, will now decide whether or not to consult its members on the offer, and whether to call off the scheduled strikes while a ballot is held.\n\nThe union's general secretary, Andrea Bradley, said she believed the recent talks had left the two sides \"within touching distance of a possible settlement\".\n\nThe EIS will hold meetings on Friday afternoon to discuss the new proposal, with Ms Bradley saying she was hopeful that \"we can move very quickly to a position where we can consult members on the offer\".\n\nThe union had been calling for a 10% pay rise this year, but has said a \"credible\" new offer could see strike action being suspended.\n\nAnother teaching union, the SSTA, has already said it will conduct a formal online ballot of its members on the improved offer.\n\nThe reaction of the EIS union to the new pay offer will be crucial as it is by far the largest union in Scottish education.\n\nIf it decides to consult its members and recommends that they accept it, the dispute would appear to be drawing towards its conclusion.\n\nBut if it rejects the offer, it would be a huge blow to hopes of a resolution.\n\nIf the EIS decides to consult its members, it would be wrong to presume how they will vote.\n\nSome may feel the offer is the best which is possible in the current financial climate.\n\nOthers would note that the new offer is still significantly lower than inflation.\n\nCouncil leaders are responsible for making pay offers to teachers as the employer.\n\nCouncillor Katie Hagmann, the resources spokeswoman for council umbrella body Cosla, said the improved offer had been made possible by funding assurances that had been given by the Scottish government.\n\nShe added: \"It is in all of our interests, not least those of children, young people and families, to conclude the teachers' pay negotiations as quickly as possible to bring back stability and certainty in our schools.\"\n\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney had earlier said he was \"very optimistic\" that the dispute would be resolved.\n\nBut he warned there will be \"programmes and projects that will not be going ahead\" because more money has been diverted into the new deal.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland earlier on Friday, Mr Swinney said all sides had come to a \"moment of compromise\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm very optimistic that we are in a position that we will be able to resolve the dispute in the course of today and to avoid any further disruption to education.\"\n\nThe EIS and the NASUWT unions recently rejected an offer worth 11.5% over two years. This included a 6% rise for 2022-23, backdated to last April, and a 5.5% increase for 2023-24.\n\nThe dispute has been running for more than a year.\n\nAlmost every state primary and secondary school in Scotland was closed on Tuesday and Wednesday as members of the EIS and NASUWT walked out in the latest national strike action.\n\nPupils in the constituencies of senior politicians have been worst affected, as targeted strike action by members of the EIS last week closed schools for three additional days.\n\nThe same areas, which include those", "m just human.\"\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez, who only moved to Swansea from the Philippines one month ago, was one of those who helped rescue Ethan Bennett after the blast.\n\nHe was walking up the stairs when Mr Davies's house exploded.\n\nAt first, he had no idea where the noise had come from but saw his front door and windows were shattered and there was \"white smoke\" in the air.\n\nDonn Fern\u00e1ndez and Donna Fontanilla only moved to the area a month ago\n\nWhen he ran outside, he could see Ethan caught in the rubble of the remains of his roof so he and several others pulled him to safety.\n\nHis wife, Donna Fontanilla, 30, said: \"I keep on telling him that you are brave, but he doesn't want to accept.\"\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez said he did what anyone else would have done in his shoes and praised Ethan: \"It's not me who saved him - it's the boy who's really brave.\"\n\nMs Fontanilla is a nurse and was at work when the blast happened.\n\nBrian Davies has been named as the man who died following the explosion\n\nWhen Mr Fern\u00e1ndez called to tell her what had happened, her first thought was for her neighbour.\n\n\"I said, 'Oh my God, how's Brian?' because I knew he was living literally in that house.

We really appreciate it. They are always making sure that we are quite comfortable - they've given us spare clothes, water, basic necessities for us to get through.\"\n\nTheir priest, Father Jason Jones, who is storing some of the possessions they were able to retrieve, said: \"I think we're just very blessed that he's part of our community and so willing to risk his own life because there could have been further explosions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the RSPCA has been working to support families and their pets who were affected by the blast.\n\nAn inspector rescued one cat, Fern, from the scene of the blast, which is now being cared for at the RSPCA's Llys Nini animal rescue centre in Penllergaer.\n\nHowever, they are still trying to find Fern's brother Teddy who remains missing - both pets belong to the Bennett family, whose home was wrecked in the explosion.\n\nEthan has been reunited with his pet cat Fern\n\nEthan was reunited with family pet Fern at Llys Nini after being rescued, but the cat will remain at the centre.\n\nSally Hyman, chairwoman of the trustees at the animal rescue centre, said: \"We've been pumping out the appeal for Teddy on our social media.

The first minister says the SNP still owes loan money to Peter Murrell\n\nThe SNP still owes money to its former chief executive Peter Murrell, First Minister Humza Yousaf has confirmed.\n\nMr Murrell, who is married to Nicola Sturgeon, gave the party a loan of \u00a3107,620 in June 2021.\n\nThe SNP had repaid about half of the money by October of that year.\n\nWhen asked whether the party still owed him money, Mr Yousaf told journalists: \"I think there is money still absolutely outstanding to Peter Murrell in terms of the repayment of the loan.\"\n\nThe first minister said he would lay out details of how much is owed after a review into the party's governance takes place.\n\nMr Murrell, who has been married to Ms Sturgeon since 2010, was in charge of running the party organisation for more than 20 years until he resigned last month.\n\nHe was arrested by police at the start of April over an investigation into SNP finances and questioned by detectives for 11 hours before being released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nPolice launched a formal investigation into the party's finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations made for an independence referendum campaign had been used.\n\nThe SNP raised \u00a3666,953 through appeals between 2017 and 2020 with a pledge to spend these funds on a future campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nFormer chief executive of the SNP", "Details have begun to emerge about the coronation ceremony for King Charles III, including 12 new pieces of specially-composed music, with an anthem by Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nThe ceremony is expected to be a shorter and more inclusive service than in 1953, with about 2,000 guests, rather than the 8,000 who attended the late Queen's coronation.\n\nCamilla, the Queen Consort, will be crowned alongside the King, but it's been revealed that her crown will not include the controversial Koh-i-Noor diamond.\n\nIt's not yet known who will be invited to the ceremony, with particular interest in whether Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex will be part of the congregation.\n\nWhat we know about the Coronation long weekend so far:\n\nSaturday 6 May: Coronation service in Westminster Abbey; coronation carriage procession; Buckingham Palace balcony appearance for the Royal Family\n\nSunday 7 May: Concert and lightshow at Windsor Castle; Coronation Big Lunch street parties\n\nMonday 8 May: Extra bank holiday; Big Help Out encouraging people to get involved in local volunteering projectsThe clean-shaven policy is to allow officers to wear protective masks\n\nPolice Scotland is planning to introduce a new clean-shaven policy for frontline officers, according to correspondence seen by the BBC.\n\nIt means hundreds of officers will have to shave off their beards and moustaches by the end of the month.\n\nFour are understood to be taking legal action in relation to the policy.\n\nPolice Scotland said it was necessary so officers and staff could wear protective FFP3 masks which require users to be clean-shaven.\n\nThe policy, which also covers civilian staff in frontline roles, has been approved by the chief constable and is due to be introduced on 29 May.\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic police officers were fitted with specialist masks designed to protect them from the virus.\n\nA message posted on Police Scotland's internal website from Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said lessons learned from the pandemic identified that FFP3 masks offered the most appropriate and effective respiratory protection to officers and staff.\n\nHe said that while the risk from coronavirus had lowered, wider risks remained to officers and staff attending calls such as fires, road accidents and chemical incidents which required PPE (personal protective equipment) to be worn.\n\nPolice Scotland's new respiratory protective equipment (RPE) policy will mean that where it can be \"reasonably foreseen\" that any officer or member of staff will use an FFP3 mask they should be clean-shaven.\n\nThis includes all local policing frontline officers, roads policing, firearms and public order officers.\n\nACC Speirs said in the message: \"The safety of our people remains a priority and it is clear that a single overarching policy on the use of protective masks is required.\"\n\nThere will be exemptions for religious, cultural, disability or medical reasons. In these circumstances, the force is seeking to introduce an alternative type of respiratory protection.\n\nPolice Scotland has about 17,000 officers and 6,000 staff.\n\nIt is the UK's second biggest force behind the Metropolitan police.\n\nThe Met's policy says \"beards and moustaches are allowed, but they mustn't look unkempt. Keep them trimmed and smart\".\n\nThe Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file police officers, said it had been inundated with complaints about the policy which it said was causing \"angst\" for many officers.\n\nIt said it was supporting several members who had lodged employment tribunal cases and had sought legal opinion relating to health and safety, discrimination and human rights.\n\nThe federation's general secretary, David Kennedy, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The health and safety executive guidance is that a policy like this should only be utilised as a last resort and there have been relevant questions raised by officers as to why this policy is now being proposed.\"\n\n\"People would be facing misconduct if they didn't shave. Some officers may have to shave twice a day for these masks to work.\"\n\nMr Kennedy said he hoped Police Scotland would reverse the decision, and said there were \"other health and safety issues\" the force should be focusing on.\n\nIn a statement, ACC Speirs said the policy was being introduced to protect those on the frontline and that the FFP3 mask \"offers the most appropriate and effective respiratory protection to officers and staff\".\n\nHe added: \"While the risk from coronavirus has lowered, wider risks remain to those attending calls, such as fires, road accidents and chemical incidents which require PPE to be worn.\n\n\"The exception to this policy covers officers and staff who cannot shave for religious, cultural, disability or medical reasons. In these circumstances, Police Scotland is seeking to introduce an alternative type of respiratory protection.\n\n\"We understand the frustrations among those affected on the frontline, but the use of PPE is absolutely necessary to protect officers and staff from serious health risks.\"\n\nACC Speirs said the force undertake a full consultation ahead of the policy being introduced, and that a full human rights impact assessment was being carried out as part of the process.\n\nThe National Sikh Police Association said it supported the new measures and could understand why Police Scotland wanted to introduce the clean shaven policy.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We welcome the exemptions, including those for our Sikh colleagues. The alternative respirators are an important component of the policy and we trust the investment in the alternative equipment will be sufficient\".Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nArsenal's fading title hopes were dealt a devastating blow after losing to Brighton to leave leaders Manchester City one win from a fifth Premier League title in six seasons.\n\nThe Gunners needed to respond after City's 3-0 win over Everton earlier on Sunday left Mikel Arteta's side trailing by four points in the race for the title.\n\nOn a deeply frustrating day for Arsenal, Leandro Trossard hit the bar against his former club while Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka both went close before Julio Enciso's close-range header put Brighton ahead.\n\nSubstitute Deniz Undav doubled the lead after lobbing Aaron Ramsdale in the 86th minute before Pervis Estupinan added to Arsenal's misery with Brighton's third in the 96th minute.\n\nCity will win the Premier League title next Sunday in front of their own fans if they beat Chelsea at home (16:00 BST), even if Arsenal defeat Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Saturday (17:30).\n\nHowever, City will be confirmed champions without playing on Saturday if the Gunners lose at Forest.\n\nIn a game littered with niggly challenges, Arsenal lost Brazil forward Gabriel Martinelli to injury in the first half after a foul by Brighton's Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo, who the Gunners tried to sign in January.\n\nBrighton, who are chasing a place in Europe for the first time, had gone close through Enciso before the 19-year-old Paraguay forward stunned the Emirates with his 51st-minute goal.\n\nThe win lifted the Seagulls above both Aston Villa and Tottenham into sixth on 58 points, four behind fifth-placed Liverpool with one game in hand.\n\nThe maximum number of points Arsenal can score is 87, while City have 85 with matches against Chelsea (home), Brighton (away) and Brentford (away) to come.\n\u2022 None Reaction from Arsenal-Brighton, plus how Sunday's Premier League action unfolded\n\u2022 None Go straight to all the best Arsenal content\n\nArsenal's players sank to their knees after the full-time whistle, the realisation quickly sinking in that their title dream was all but over after being picked off by Brighton.\n\nThe Gunners deserve enormous credit for the way they have pushed Manchester City in the title race. They were eight points clear of City at the top after 18 games but their pursuit is running out of steam after a highly damaging defeat at the business end of the season.\n\nManchester City's comfortable win at Everton earlier on Sunday opened up a four-point gap at the top but this time Arsenal were unable to respond to the pressure heaped on them by Pep Guardiola's Treble-chasing team.\n\nThere was still almost 40 minutes left when Enciso opened the scoring and Arteta sent on Eddie Nketiah and Em", "47-656 BC).\n\n\"Netflix is trying to provoke confusion by spreading false and deceptive facts that the origin of the Egyptian civilisation is black,\" he added and called on Egyptians to take a stand against the streaming giant.\n\nOn Sunday, lawyer Mahmoud al-Semary filed a complaint with the public prosecutor demanding that he take \"the necessary legal measures\" and block access to Netflix's services in Egypt.\n\nHe alleged that the series included visual material and content that violated Egypt's media laws and accused Netflix of trying to \"promote the Afrocentric thinking... which includes slogans and writings aimed at distorting and erasing the Egyptian identity\".\n\nThree years ago, plans for a movie about Cleopatra starring the Israeli actress Gal Gadot triggered a heated debate on social media, with some people insisting that the role should instead go to an Arab or African actress.\n\nGadot subsequently defended the casting decision, saying: \"We were looking for a Macedonian actress that could fit Cleopatra. She wasn't there, and I was very passionate about Cleopatra.\"At least 26 people have died in Mississippi and Alabama after a tornado tore through the southern US states.\n\nSurveillance video footage from Amory High School in Mississippi shows the intensity of the storm.A 4.8 magnitude earthquake struck New York City and surrounding areas on Friday.\n\nThe epicentre of the tremor was near Lebanon, New Jersey, about 40 miles (64km) west of New York City.\n\nIt's the region's most significant earthquake in decades.\n\nNew York's governor, Kathy Hochul, said that infrastructure in the area was being reviewed.\n\nThe city's mayor, Eric Adams, added: \"We do not have any reports of major impacts or injuries\".Lawson Wood made his first scuba dive nearly 60 years ago\n\nWhen Lawson Wood was a boy growing up in the Borders he was constantly getting into trouble with his mother.\n\nBorn in Duns, he moved to a house \"between the school and the sea\" in Eyemouth - and that was where a lifelong fascination began.\n\nHis mother would tell him \"home first, then the beach\" but he inevitably ended up with his school uniform soaking.\n\nLittle could either of them have imagined that it would lead to a career as an underwater photographer.\n\nHe now has more than 50 books to his name - and many awards - with two new editions of his works An Underwater Guide to the Red Sea and The World's Best Tropical Dive Destinations just released.\n\n\"I was born and brought up in the Scottish Borders and lived just next to the sea, really, in Eyemouth - virtually as far south in the south-east of Scotland, as you can get,\" he said.\n\n\"So I spent my youth scrabbling around the rock pools, going to the sea.\n\n\"I just had this utter fascination for what I could see in the rock pools or washed up on the beach and started exploring more and attempting to find out a bit more about things as well.\"\n\nIt quickly led to more serious underwater adventures.\n\n\"I got a mask and snorkel and then I could see further,\" he said.\n\n\"I had my first scuba dive at age 11 - that's back in August 1965 - and I wasn't 12 until the October.\n\n\"From then on, I guess, a passion has become a profession.\"\n\nLawson's work has taken him \"pretty much all around the UK\" and then on to Europe, the Red Sea and the Caribbean - which means it is not easy to answer which location he likes best.\n\n\"It's really hard, to be honest with you, because you can't really compare,\" he explained.\n\n\"I can't compare Eyemouth with the likes of the Red Sea because they're entirely different types of of water.\"\n\nHe describes the latter as \"clear blue\" with tropical fish and coral reefs even if there are \"equally as brilliant colours in waters around the UK and Scotland in particular\".\n\nWhen pressed, though, he admits that his favourite spot probably has to be off the south east coast of Scotland.\n\n\"I helped to co-found the Berwickshire Marine Reserve, so this is obviously very close to my heart,\" he said.\n\nAnd how does underwater photography differ from the dry land variety?\n\n\"I could try and paint you a picture,\" said Lawson.\n\n\"Apart from being in the sea, of course, you know it's salt water, so it's extremely corrosive, you're physically under pressure because of the environment.\n\n\"You're in a reduced light, you're moving and the element around you is probably also moving and the creature or animal or whatever it is that you're trying to photograph is also moving.\"\n\nHe said you also have to get used to having a limited amount of time to get your shot with factors such as air supply and equipment playing a part.\n\nThere have been occasions too when he has got into some difficulties.\n\n\"I have been in areas where there have been really strong currents,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to try and either swim out of them or go along with them and if there's a support boat overhead then you're just going to put up a little marker buoy where the boat can see where you are.\n\n\"When you eventually get back up, you know, you might be half a mile away from where you started but at least the boat will be there to see your marker buoy and collect you.\"\n\nLawson has also encountered creatures most of us would rather keep at a much greater distance.\n\n\"I've obviously been in the water many times with sharks,\" he said.\n\n\"There's only been a couple of times when I've thought: 'I'm not so sure I am enjoying this experience'.\n\n\"But again, you know, they're just wild animals and you're in their domain and they're a lot more comfortable in their space than we are.\"\n\nHe laughs at any suggestion he might want a quiet retirement away from the sea.\n\n\"I'm 69 now, I'm 70 in October - I don't really have any plans to stop,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm working on a few projects right now which get me into the water both here and overseas.\"\n\nHe is currently editing one book about the Mediterranean and is about to start another on the North Sea and the English Channel.\n\nSo the next time you see a figure emerging from the water with a camera in its hand it might just be that boy who started out scrabbling around in the rock pools of the Scottish Borders.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.A new record has been made by a group of skydivers in Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe team of 41 jumpers combined above Skydive Langar to create the largest ever sequential formation dive to take place in the UK.\n\nFormation skydiving involves participants taking hold of one another to create shapes while falling at speeds of about 120mph (193km/h) for up to one minute, Skydive Langar said.\n\nThey set the record by making two consecutive shapes in the sky involving all 41 people -

Watch: You are not building 40 brand new hospitals, are you? - Barclay pressed on pledge\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay has admitted not all the 40 new hospitals promised for England by 2030 will be brand new.\n\nHe told the BBC the pledge covered a \"range\" of building work.\n\nRefurbishments and new wings are also included in the figure.\n\nMr Barclay also acknowledged that some of the hospitals originally promised would now be completed after 2030 but a total of 40 projects would still be finished by that date.\n\nPressed over whether a refurbishment could be considered a \"new\" hospital, Mr Barclay told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"If it's a new wing, a new facility, a women's and children hospital for example as part of a wider compass... what matters to you as a patient is whether the facilities are state of the art, whether they're new.\"\n\nMr Barclay said: \"We're being honest in saying there will be difficulties on some of the schemes. There's often local factors that need to be worked through like land acquisitions, service redesign\u2026 which make it challenging to complete those by 2030.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are being honest that some schemes will take slightly longer than 2030 but we're going to get on with them.\"\n\nThe commitment to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 was made by Boris Johnson and included in the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto.\n\nHowever, this week the government said eight schemes would now be completed after 2030 to prioritise five other more urgent developments.\n\nThe five hospitals are deemed at risk of collapse because of deteriorating concrete infrastructure.\n\nEarlier this week Mr Barclay insisted the government would still meet its manifesto pledge because as well as these five hospitals it would also build three mental health hospitals on top of the original projects promised.\n\nOn Sunday's programme he continued to refer to \"40 new hospitals\" even though he finally accepted that not all of them would be brand new.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"What the manifesto said was 40 new hospitals, that is what we committed to in the House [of Commons] on Thursday.\"\n\nA BBC investigation last week found building work was yet to start for 33 of the government's promised 40 new hospitals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: BMA responds after health secretary calls pay demand not 'fair and reasonable'\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Barclay clashed with the leader of the junior doctors' union, who also appeared on the programme, over the government's pay offer.\n\nHe accused junior doctors of being unreasonable by refusing to budge on their demand for a 35% pay rise.\n\nBut Dr Vivek Trivedi, who co-chairs the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee, said deals that amounted to a real-terms pay cut were \"driving doctors away\".\n\nJunior doctors are set to walk out for 72 hours in June after pay talks stalled.\n\nIt will be the third time junior doctors in England have staged strikes this year, after industrial action in March and April.\n\nMinisters have offered a 5% pay rise but Dr Trivedi said this would amount to \"a massive real-terms pay cut\" due to rising prices.\n\n\"It was clear that after the government offered us their 5%, despite us going back and being creative\u2026 they were the ones who wouldn't budge,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Barclay said: \"They've refused to move from the 35%. And I don't think that is a fair and reasonable demand for them to take.\"\n\nHe added: \"We want to engage with them, we have been doing. It's the junior doctors who walked away from those negotiations by calling strikes.\"\n\nThe health secretary insisted the government had already improved its pay offer from what was originally recommended by the independent pay review body.\n\nAsked what it would take to resolve the dispute, Dr Trivedi said: \"We're trying all we can and are eager and ready to get back to the negotiating table - it is the government who are refusing to meet us there.\n\n\"We have budged and are very happy to explore ways to fully restore our doctor's pay and we've come up with a variety of proposals to do that.\"\n\nThe BMA says junior doctors have seen pay cut by 26% since 2008 once inflation - the rate prices are rising - is taken into account. The union wants a 35% pay rise to reverse this.\n\nDr Trivedi said a pay offer which did not reverse this trajectory \"would not be fair or reasonable\".The British embassy in Kabul, pictured here in 2006\n\nA group of Nepalese security guards who worked at the British embassy in Kabul have been told their threatened removal from the UK has been paused.\n\nThe Gurkhas have been in the UK since being rescued from the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nPapers had been issued ordering their removal to Nepal and India, with some of the men being detained following a raid at their hotel.\n\nBut the Home Office says their removal has now been halted.\n\nA spokesperson told Radio 4's The World Tonight on Wednesday: \"Removal of this cohort has been paused, pending further review.\"\n\nSome of the men had already been given an indefinite right to live in the UK by the Home Office - which earlier denied that it was removing anyone with that status.\n\nA total of 13 Nepalese military veterans had been employed guarding the high-security compound housing the UK and Canadian embassies in Kabul.\n\nLast week, 10 of them were detained in handcuffs in an early morning raid on their west London hotel - where they had been living and working in its kitchen, serving food to Afghan refugees.\n\nThey were held in immigration removal centres close to Gatwick and Heathrow airports, with the first flight due to leave on Thursday.\n\nA lawyer for some of the group, Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said after the u-turn that he was \"delighted for our clients that there won't be pending removal\".\n\n\"However, it raises the question about why this has happened to begin with,\" he told The World Tonight.\n\n\"Why couldn't this review and consideration happen before there was significant media interest and before legal action had to be threatened?\"\n\nMr Bell said the case raised further questions about the scheme set up following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.\n\n\"These schemes have been poorly drafted, poorly implemented, and they're not helping the people they are meant to be helping,\" Mr Bell added.\n\nThe government has rescued 25,000 people from the country under two resettlement schemes - the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme, which focuses on women, children and religious minorities, and the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy, for Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government.\n\nThe Afghan capital fell to the Taliban in August 2021, as the government of President Ashraf Ghani collapsed and he fled the country.\n\nThousands of Afghans who had served alongside British military and government personnel were evacuated from Kabul amid chaotic scenes.\n\nThe British embassy in Kabul suspended in-country operations following the Taliban takeover, with all diplomatic and consular staff withdrawn from Afghanistan.

In each, a text was read out and contestants tried to transcribe it without error.\n\nIn the first, 1,397 people wrestled with an excerpt from a short story by 19th Century author Alphonse Daudet.\n\nThat session was recognised by Guinness World Records as the largest such competition ever, French media say.\n\nFrench spelling is notoriously tricky and dictations have inspired dread in generations of pupils from Dunkerque to Perpignan.\n\nHowever some 50,000 people applied for Sunday's \"Grande Dict\u00e9e des Champs\" and about 5,000 people - many of them schoolchildren - took part.\n\nThe second and third rounds were based on a modern short story and a text about rugby respectively.\n\nAfter the first, a 10-year-old described as a \"star pupil\" told AFP news agency: \"It was impossible!\"\n\nHis 42-year-old father Adrien Blind, who took the same test, said it had left him \"in a state of stress and worry\".\n\nBut 65-year-old Touria Zerhouni was more relaxed. \"I only made two mistakes.

Robert Jenrick: \"We don't want to be using hotels [for housing asylum seekers] at all\"\n\nThe UK has to \"reduce its reliance on hotels\" for housing asylum seekers, immigration minister Robert Jenrick has said.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said he had to look after taxpayers and his duty was to the British public over migrants.\n\nHe added it was \"fair and reasonable\" to ask asylum seekers to share rooms in hotels in some circumstances.\n\nIt follows a dispute with asylum seekers over their temporary accommodation in central London.\n\nLast week, about 40 asylum seekers were offered space in a Pimlico hotel, but refused to enter after being asked to sleep four people per room.\n\nHead of Westminster Council Adam Huq expressed his concern in a letter to the home secretary, saying people who \"are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events\" were being asked to share \"an inappropriately sized room with multiple strangers\".\n\nAsked about the case on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Jenrick said the government did not want to use hotels, arguing it was \"taking away valuable assets for the local business community... people's weddings and personal events have had to be cancelled\".\n\n\"But where we are using them, it's right that we get good value for money for the taxpayer,\" he added.\n\n\"And so if single adult males can share a room, and it's legal to do so, which will obviously depend on the size of the accommodation, then we'll ask people to do that,\" he added.\n\nHowever, he denied it was government policy for asylum seekers and migrants to be housed in shared rooms.\n\nHe also suggested people were making illegitimate asylum claims, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the UK's system was \"riddled with abuse\". The country could not be allowed to be \"perceived as a soft touch\", he added.\n\nLabour said in response: \"After 13 years of Tory failure, the asylum system isn't just broken - it's costing tax payers a fortune - only Labour has a proper plan to stop dangerous boat crossings.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the numbers coming to the UK illegally one of his key priorities. Part of his plan is to implement the Illegal Migration Bill, currently going through Parliament.\n\nIt would give ministers new powers to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally and stop them claiming asylum here.\n\nBut it has attracted fierce criticism including from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said it risked \"great damage\" to the UK's reputation.\n\nThe BBC understands the Home Office estimates the plans in the bill could cost between \u00a33bn and \u00a36bn through spending on detention facilities, as well as ongoing accommodation and removals.\n\nLast year the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats via the English Channel hit over 45,000 - the highest number since figures were first collected in 2018. So far this year, 7,610 people have made the crossing, a fall of more than 2,000 compared with the same time last year.\n\nThe number of people claiming asylum has also risen with figures in 2022 hitting a near 20-year high of 74,751.\n\nThe government has a legal obligation to provide asylum seekers - who are not allowed to work while their claim is being processed - with a basic level of accommodation.\n\nAsylum seekers would typically only be housed in hotels or hostels for a few weeks, before being moved to long-term self-catered homes.\n\nHowever the increase in people claiming asylum -and the backlog of unprocessed claims - has led to a growth in the use of hotels to provide temporary accommodation.\n\nGovernment sources have previously told the BBC it is using 395 hotels to home more than 51,000 asylum seekers.\n\nThe use of hotels has proved to be expensive, costing almost \u00a37m a day. It has also prompted anger among many Conservative MPs, who say the plan puts a strain on local amenities.\n\nPeople believed to be asylum seekers arriving in Kent\n\nMinisters are trying different ways to accommodate the rising numbers of people who are coming to the UK, including housing people in barges or facilities on air bases.\n\nMr Jenrick was keen to repeat his assertion that the government was taking a robust approach, and that by asking migrants to share rooms he wanted to cut the costs to the taxpayer.\n\nBut he was less keen to acknowledge that the backlog for asylum claims is extremely high, and that compared to a few years ago, it takes much longer for cases to be resolved.\n\nThe problems with accommodation at the hundreds of hotels around the country would be far less acute if there were fewer people stuck in the system.\n\nWhen it comes to how ministers handle the issues, there are not many easy answers.\n\nBut while Conservative ministers say they want to bring immigration down, they have presided over the numbers going up and up. There is a serious clash between the rhetoric and the reality.\n\nIn addition to illegal migration, there has also been an increase in people coming to the UK legally - the most recent figures saw net migration rise by 606,000.\n\nIn 2010, the Conservatives promised to reduce net migration to below 100,000.\n\nAsked if that number was still realistic, Mr Jenrick said he didn't think targets were \"particularly helpful\" because \"behaviours are constantly changing\".This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Specialist paramedics at the scene of Swansea blast\n\nSpecialist paramedics were among dozens of emergency workers called to the scene of a house explosion in Swansea last week.\n\nThe Hazardous Area Response Team (Hart), which is part of the Welsh Ambulance Service, are trained to enter the scene of major incidents and immediately start life-saving treatment.\n\nArriving there within 30 minutes of the initial 999 call, one of the crew members was wearing a camera supplied by BBC Wales as part of a film project.\n\n\"It was like a movie set with debris everywhere and bits of house in the trees around you,\" said specialist paramedic Gareth Denman.\n\nHe was faced with the \"surreal\" scene in a terraced street in Morriston following the incident that killed one person and left three others in hospital.\n\n\"There was lots of destruction", "told by his advisers was an accurate picture of what was known about what had gone on.\n\nCritics will \u2014 and already have - argued that this couldn't possibly be the case given he had actually attended some of the gatherings we later learnt about.\n\nSo the stage is set for Wednesday afternoon. Seven MPs. Four Conservatives. Two Labour, including the chair, Harriet Harman. And one from the SNP.\n\nLike any select committee, the questioning will begin from the chair, and then each MP will take it in turns to ask their set of questions. The committee has been meeting this week to divide up who will ask what and in what order.\n\nSo could this end Mr Johnson's political career? Well, it might not. But it could.\n\nIt's worth saying plenty of Conservative MPs think, hope, it is as good as over already. Others dream of political reincarnation.\n\nIf the committee were to recommend a suspension from the Commons of 10 or more days, and MPs endorsed this, he would face what is known as a \"recall petition\" in his constituency, which could lead to a by-election.\n\nThere are a lot of coulds and caveats before that point.\n\nOnce Mr Johnson is done on Wednesday, the committee will have to decide if it wants to talk to anyone else (I'm told that's unlikely) or hear, via written testimony, from anyone else. That's possible.\n\nAnd then they'll write up and publish their findings. That, I'm told, will definitely be before the summer, but probably after Easter. And any suggested sanction will then be voted on by MPs.\n\nThe story of Boris Johnson is far from over.Thabo Bester remained at large for a year before being arrested in Tanzania earlier this month\n\nThe father of a man whose body was used by a notorious South African rapist to escape from prison has demanded to know how his son died.\n\nThabo Bester managed to break out of prison last year after faking his own death by setting fire to his cell.\n\nA body was found inside, which was initially believed to be Bester's but it has now been identified as belonging to Katlego Bereng Mpholo.\n\nHis father, Batho Mpholo, says he needs \"the truth and nothing but the truth\".\n\nHe says that police told him that his son had collapsed in the city of Bloemfontein and then died in hospital, before he was taken to a mortuary.\n\n\"How did Thabo Bester get hold of my son's body if he was in a government mortuary,\" he asked in an interview with the ENCA news channel. He later said he would sue the state.\n\nWhen the body found in the cell was re-examined in March this year after suspicions were raised by local media, it was found that the person had died as a result of blunt-force trauma to the head.\n\nMr Mpholo says he does not believe the police account of what had happened to his son, who was aged 30 when he went missing in April 2022.\n\nThe South African police declined to comment on Mr Mpholo's statement, beyond saying that they were pleased to bring closure to the family.\n\nMr Mpholo says that relatives went to Bloemfontein's mortuaries looking for him and there was no sign of him - and no news until his mother was asked to do a DNA test last week.\n\nMr Mpholo describes his son as a fun-loving soccer fan, who leaves behind a daughter aged four and a son aged two.\n\n\"I am broken. My heart is shattered into a million pieces,\" he told the News24 website.\n\nHe says the family has not yet seen his body, and so hasn't been able to start organising a funeral.\n\nKatlego Bereng Mpholo's mother, Monica Matsie, broke down in tears while being interviewed by national broadcaster SABC.\n\nKatlego Bereng Mpholo was a fan of the Bloemfontein Celtics\n\nDuring the confusion caused by the fire in the Mangaung Correctional Centre in Bloemfontein, Bester managed to escape from prison dressed as a warder.\n\nNews of the escape caused widespread shock and outrage in South Africa, where local media dubbed him the \"Facebook rapist\" because he used the site to lure women with promises of jobs before attacking them.\n\nHe had been serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2012 for the rape and murder of his model girlfriend Nomfundo Tyhulu. The previous year, he had been found guilty of raping and robbing two other women.\n\nAfter his escape Bester managed to live undetected for a year before he was arrested earlier this month in Tanzania and then deported to South Africa, along with his girlfriend, celebrity doctor Nandipha Magudumana.\n\nMs Magudumana, her father and two employees of the British security firm G4S which ran the prison have been arrested for allegedly helping him escape. They have not yet commented on the accusations.Oil, gas and coal representatives will have to disclose their industry ties at future climate meetings, the UN says.\n\nFor years, fossil fuel employees have been able to attend without having to be clear about their relationship with their companies.\n\nLast year, over 600 industry participants were able to enter the COP27 meeting in Egypt.\n\nCampaigners say the UN ruling is the first step to limiting the influence of polluters.\n\nThe new rules will be in place for the COP28 summit in November in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, one of the world's top oil producers.

The problem though is that often employees of coal, oil and gas companies are not open about their affiliations.\n\nAt COP26 in Glasgow, there were more delegates from the fossil fuel industries than from any single country.\n\nLast year at COP27 in Egypt, the numbers had swollen by a quarter, with more than 600 representatives according to analysis from campaign group, Global Witness.\n\nWith registration for delegates to this year's COP28 summit in Dubai set to open soon, the UN will now put in place a mandatory question on affiliation.\n\n\"From now onwards, every single badged participant attending the event will be required to list their affiliation and relationship to that organisation,\" said UN climate chief Simon Stiell, speaking at the closing of a preparatory meeting in Bonn.\n\nCampaigners say the step is long overdue.\n\nDelegates representing fossil fuel industries have increased in number over the last two climate conferences\n\n\"As long as UN climate talks have existed, the fossil fuel industry lobbyists have been flooding these talks seeking a seat at the table where the rules of climate action are written,\" said Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability.\n\n\"It's actually no small thing that for the first time ever, all participants, will have to be honest to the world about who they are.\"\n\nObservers say that the new requirement might prevent a recurrence of what happened last year when BP chair Bernard Looney attended the talks as a delegate of Mauritania, a poor African country where the company has major investments.\n\nSimilarly, four senior employees of Total, the French oil company, came to the COP as representatives of a mysterious German environmental campaign group.\n\nHowever while information on a delegate's affiliation will now be mandatory, participants will be allowed to opt out on the nature of their relationship to that organisation.\n\nThere will also be no requirement to say who's financing the trip to the COP.\n\nIf delegates do opt out from providing some information, the UN will publish these blank answers in their lists, allowing people to draw their own conclusions.\n\n\"This information should help prevent those representing the interests of fossil fuels from sneaking through the back door without declaring their true intentions,\" said Alice Harrison, from Global Witness, who compile an annual list of fossil fuel delegates attending the COP.\n\nSultan Al Jaber, from the United Arab Emirates is the", "dolls, donated by her late aunt and customers, in the pub for nearly 10 years.\n\nThe dolls are based on 18th Century minstrels and are regarded as caricatures.\n\nThe doll is a fictional character created by Florence Kate Upton that appeared in children's books in the late 19th Century, usually depicted as a type of rag doll.

It's not independent. We want it to be taken out of the political arena,\" she said.\n\nThe Wales Covid-19 Inquiry Special Purpose Committee was set up as part of a deal between Welsh Labour and the Welsh Conservatives, to identify any gaps in what the UK inquiry said about Wales.\n\nIt follows a long-running row over whether Wales needs its own inquiry into the pandemic, calls for which have been resisted by the Welsh government.\n\nLucy O'Brien, a lawyer with extensive experience in public inquiries and judicial reviews, said she was concerned that the Senedd committee would not have the resources to adequately scrutinise decisions made during the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \"With an independent public inquiry, the inquiry would be resourced to approach witnesses and compel evidence and hold public hearings.\n\n\"Say the UK public inquiry found there were issues with care homes in Wales and that was part of Baroness Hallett's recommendations, would the Senedd committee then be contacting care homes in Wales to obtain evidence? I think that's unlikely because I think they're unlikely to be resourced to do so.\"\n\nLawyer Lucy O'Brien says she is concerned the Senedd committee will not have adequate resources\n\nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said they would not be providing running commentary on the evidence the inquiry was taking and would not be speculating on any conclusions the inquiry may come to.\n\nMs O'Brien said she was \"surprised\" the Welsh government voted against holding a Welsh independent public inquiry.\n\n\"We know Wales went in its own very different direction to the UK government during the pandemic and that in many areas the response in Wales was different to the rest of the UK,\" she said.\n\n\"It's surprising to us from a legal perspective that the Senedd voted against that.\"\n\nThe committee is being co-chaired by Joyce Watson, Labour Member of the Senedd for Mid and West Wales, and Tom Giffard, Conservative MS for South Wales West.\n\nThe Conservatives are co-chairing the committee with Welsh Labour which has been criticised by Plaid Cymru.\n\nPlaid Cymru health spokesperson Mabon ap Gwynfor said both parties wanted to \"quieten the issue\" of a public inquiry and \"push it into the long grass\".\n\n\"It's not just the gaps we need to look at, we need to look at the Covid issue in the round in Wales because health is devolved,\" he said.\n\nLeader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said the party was committed to \"enabling this committee to work to its fullest ability like any scrutiny committee in the Welsh Parliament.\"\n\nHe added: \"The challenge is obviously to government backbenchers to make sure they step up to the plate and act as backbenchers, not an extension of the Welsh government.\"This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Mr Hayes told the BBC he did not know what to feel as \"it has been so, so long\".\n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body set up to investigate miscarriages of justice, has decided to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe CCRC made a provisional decision in 2021 not to refer his case. But two months later the US courts decided the cases against the traders were fundamentally flawed.\n\nMr Hayes served five and a half years in jail and was released in January 2021, still protesting his innocence.\n\nA total of 37 traders and brokers on both sides of the Atlantic have been prosecuted by the US Department of Justice and the Serious Fraud Office for \"rigging\" interest rates.\n\nThe interest rate traders were accused of manipulating was Libor, the benchmark interest rate that tracks the cost of borrowing cash.\n\nIn January 2022, a US appeal court overturned the convictions of British-born former Deutsche Bank trader Gavin Black and his US colleague Matt Connolly, saying prosecutors had failed to prove they had made any false statements in their trials for fraud.\n\nThe US withdrew its own separate indictment against Mr Hayes last year.

Mr Wallace said the government did not plan on issuing a new version so soon, but the world has shifted and become more volatile.\n\nMr Wallace, who plans to step down as defence secretary at the next cabinet reshuffle after four years in the job, said: \"The war in Ukraine has focused minds because there is a very real adversary being very aggressive, breaking all the rules of war on the continent of Europe, fighting a war designed to destroy a country.\n\n\"That makes us realise we had better change the risk appetite we had when we did this paper originally.\n\n\"Originally we were taking things out of service, having a bit of a gap in the middle of the decade, and then we'd have the new equipment. That's something I don't want to risk any more.\"\n\nThe experience of Ukraine's armed forces, and the way in which allies have been able to assist - including quick adaptations of existing equipment to suit Kyiv's needs - is a thread running through much of Tuesday's paper.\n\nIt says one of the lessons learnt from the war is that the pace of innovation is getting faster - and cannot be met by the traditional, often decades-long programmes to get equipment. Instead, equipment should be designed with the possibility of making quick upgrades, the paper says.\n\nIt also highlights the need to harness the latest technology - including AI and quantum computing - to make Britain's armed forces more agile and adaptive.\n\n\"New technologies are not gimmicks, they're fundamentally key to how we fight a modern war,\" Mr Wallace said.\n\nHe added that analysing the strategies playing out in Ukraine would help \"make sure that we can be match fit for any future conflict\".\n\nThe document also sets out plans for more personnel to have a \"zigzag\" career path - which could include leaving the military to gain experience elsewhere and then re-joining.\n\nYoung people \"envisage careers that are flexible and see themselves working in a number of different professions, rather than progressing within a single organisation\", the document says - and so the government will embrace \"greater opportunity for career mobility between jobs in defence and whatever other employment they'd like to pursue elsewhere\".\n\nAnd it says \u00a3400m will be spent on modernising accommodation for service families. This money was already in the defence budget but has been reallocated.\n\nThe refresh is not about cuts to the size of the army - this was already announced in a review in 2021, with a plan to cut the Army to 72,500 soldiers by 2025.\n\nAnother such lesson from the war in Ukraine is the \"power of electronic warfare\", Mr Wallace said, explaining: \"The use of [electronic] warfare either to act as a decoy or to act as a defence is becoming really important, so it goes up the priority list.\"\n\nHe said that the war in Ukraine had also concentrated minds on the use of \"deep fire\" artillery, and had informed the decision to retire old 155mm guns and bring in new replacements.\n\n\"We have seen a generational shift in ranges of 'deep fire' artillery,\" he said. \"The 155mm gun roughly had a 22-25km range for about 50 years.\n\n\"The new generation ... you're getting ranges of 60km in future. So I have taken a decision to phase out the old 155mm [for] the Swedish Archer 1.\"\n\nArtillery has played a significant role for both sides in Ukraine. Britain's armed forces, however, have scaled down their artillery forces since the end of the Cold War.\n\nMr Wallace said: \"At the end of the Second World War, 35% of the army was artillery. Now, it's roughly 8%. Deep fire is something we need to rebalance. These are the lessons.\"\n\nLabour said the plan was \"driven by costs, not by threats\", and also questioned whether it would stand the test of time, with Mr Wallace due to step down.\n\n\"As his own future is now short, how long is the shelf life of his plan?\" asked shadow defence secretary John Healey.\n\n\"Industry and military leaders cannot be sure his", "on the shore.\n\nAndy Hill, owner of Troggs Surf Shop, near East Strand beach, said the warning has had a serious impact on trade.\n\nMr Hill, who also operates a surf school and equipment rental service, said both were forced to close.\n\nTroggs Surf School was forced to close as a result of the red flags\n\n\"The surf has been terrible for months but today was the best it's been all summer,\" he told BBC News NI on Friday.\n\n\"It's just so frustrating.\"\n\nAlgal blooms are caused by water pollution and certain weather conditions.\n\nInvasive species like zebra mussels also contribute to the problem by cleaning the water, allowing sunlight to penetrate more deeply and stimulate algal growth.\n\nGeorge Nelson, owner of Babushka cafe, which overlooks Portrush harbour, said he was glad to see a response to the potential health threat.\n\n\"We're trying to stay positive and are hoping it's only a matter of a day or two,\" he said.\n\nMr Nelson praised the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs' (DAERA) response to the situation.\n\n\"They've been very good at monitoring the situation and updating us,\" he said.\n\n\"Better to keep people safe and get back to it when the time is right.\"\n\nAnyone seeing anything they suspect might be blue-green algae is urged to report it using the Bloomin' Algae reporting app.\n\nA DAERA spokesperson said: \"The presence of blue green algae is being investigated at Portrush Harbour and Portstewart Harbour.\n\n\"To date, no evidence of blue green algae has been reported at the adjacent identified bathing water sites to Portrush Harbour and Portstewart Harbour.\n\n\"Please follow advice provided by the landowner or operator of the river, lake or beach.\"An investigation has been launched after claims of \"bullying and a toxic culture\" at publicly-funded Welsh-language channel S4C.\n\nThe independent external investigation comes after the claims were made by a union representing staff.\n\nA letter written by the Bectu union described a \"a culture of fear\" within the organisation.\n\nS4C said it has decided to appoint a law firm to undertake an independent investigation into concerns raised.\n\nThe broadcaster has been based in Carmarthen since moving from Cardiff in 2014.\n\nEstablished in 1982, at the same time Channel 4 was launched, S4C has been an integral part of Welsh media for the past 40 years.\n\nAmong its successes are SuperTed, Sam Tan (translated to Fireman Sam) and long-running soap Pobol y Cwm.\n\nMore recently, hit dramas such as Y Gwyll (Hinterland), Un Bore Mercher (Keeping Faith) and Dal y Mellt (Rough Cut) have registered success in the English language too.\n\nThis investigation will come as a big shock to a TV channel which claims it contributed \u00a3141.1m to the Welsh economy in 2019-20.\n\nBectu's negotiation secretary in Wales, Carwyn Donovan, wrote a letter to independent members of the channel's executive board which described \"staff regularly being brought to tears\" and \"too scared to share their experiences\".\n\nMr Donovan said in his letter that the meeting was \"the most shocking\" in his career as a trade union representative, noting \"four staff members broke down in tears\" while \"giving their accounts of the situation\".\n\nS4C chairman Rhodri Williams announced the board had decided to appoint legal firm Capital Law to undertake the investigation.\n\nRhodri Williams says he is \"comfortable\" that the channel has responded in the \"appropriate way\" to the allegations\n\nHe said the letter \"obviously didn't make for comfortable reading,\" and that \"a number of points raised, if proved to be true, would give us serious concerns.\"\n\n\"They are not the type of things anyone responsible for any organisation would like to read, be that a private or a public organisation,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether the board had been slow to react to concerns raised by some members of staff, Mr Williams denied it, and said he was \"comfortable\" the board's independent members had responded \"in the proper manner and with the requisite speed\".\n\nHe urged staff to come forward to share any concerns they may have and said he would \"keep an open mind\" as to allowing contributions from any former employees who had recently left S4C.\n\nIf allegations of bullying were proved, he said he would be willing to take \"necessary steps\".\n\nAccording to the letter, S4C chief executive Si\u00e2n Doyle said that \"the term bullying is shared too easily\"\n\nThe union letter was shared via an anonymous email with the BBC-produced news programme Newyddion S4C.\n\nIt noted that staff have shared experiences with union representatives of \"being ignored, belittled, undermined, or patronised by members of the management team\".\n\nIt also gave examples of management team members acting inappropriately and disrespectfully towards other staff, and when they raised legitimate questions, they received aggressive and confrontational behaviour from management team members.\n\nThe letter also detailed that the situation had been fragile for some time, with the union aware of complaints since last November.\n\nIn a meeting with the chief executive Sian Doyle, the union official said she recognised \"things had been difficult, and that managers were at fault for the way people felt\", but according to the letter, she also said \"the term 'bullying' is thrown about too easily\".\n\nBectu said it was reassured by the prompt and unequivocal response it has received from the S4C Unitary Board - made up of non-executive members who do not work for the channel, and executive members on the S4C management team - regarding its members' complaints.\n\n\"We are pleased they have agreed to appoint an independent investigator, whom we look forward to working with,\" it said.\n\n\"As a union we are committed to stamping out bullying and harassment wherever it occurs and we are here to support.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative culture spokesman Tom Giffard said the allegations were \"deeply concerning\", and for the \"wider impact on the reputation of our Welsh language broadcaster\".\n\nHe welcomed the appointment of the legal firm to investigate, adding: \"It is essential that staff at all levels come forward at this time to share their experiences and that S4C engages fully with the investigation\".Members of the Royal Family have been spotted leaving Westminster Abbey after a rehearsal in advance of the King's Coronation on Saturday.\n\nKing Charles and Camilla, the Queen

The three other people in the car managed to escape.\n\nA man and a young person are also missing after the vehicle they were in was also submerged. Two people were rescued from the vehicle.\n\nRoads have been washed away and bridges have been weakened in Nova Scotia, where a state of emergency has been announced in some areas.\n\n\"We have a scary, significant situation,\" said Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston, adding that at least seven bridges would have to be replaced or rebuilt.\n\n\"The property damage to homes ... is pretty unimaginable,\" he told a news conference.\n\nHe estimated that is could take several days for the waters to recede.\n\nMore than 80,000 people were left without power at one point.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was very concerned about the floods and promised that the government \"will be there\" for the province.\n\nEnvironment Canada says torrential rain in the eastern area of the province could continue into Sunday.\n\n\"People should not assume that everything is over. This is a very dynamic situation,\" Halifax Mayor Mike Savage told a press conference.\n\nHe added that the city had been hit by \"biblical proportions of rain\".\n\nThe flooding is the latest extreme weather event to hit northeast Canada - recent wildfires have burnt a record area, sending clouds of smoke south into the US.\n\nThere has also been extreme flooding in the US this month. The body of a two-year-old girl found along a river in Pennsylvania is believed to be one of two missing children swept away by flash floods last weekend. Her nine-month-old brother is still missing.\n\nScientists cannot say for certain that such extreme rainfall is caused by climate change, but the floods are consistent with the changes they expect in a warming world.\n\nThis is because the warmer the earth becomes the more moisture the atmosphere can hold. This results in more droplets and heavier rainfall, sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Listen: Ken Bruce - \"I have loved being here with you.\"\n\nDJ Ken Bruce paid tribute to his listeners as he signed off from BBC Radio 2 after more than three decades of hosting the mid-morning show.\n\nThe Scottish presenter, 72, is leaving the network to join commercial station Greatest Hits Radio.\n\nBruce closed Friday's programme by playing Golden Slumbers by The Beatles.\n\nQuoting the song, he told listeners: \"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make - and I have loved being here with you.\"\n\nHe added: \"Thank you so much, and may we meet again somewhere.\"\n\nBruce hosted Radio 2's weekday mid-morning programme for more than three decades, and had been on BBC radio in some form for 46 years.\n\nHe said: \"Thank you to everybody who has contributed in any small way to this programme, particularly the listeners.\n\n\"I really couldn't do it without the listeners, who contribute and complete the dialogue. We talk to each other on a daily basis, and I hope sometime in the future we may be able to continue doing that.\"\n\nAfter receiving well wishes throughout the programme, Bruce joked: \"Thanks to all who sent any kind of messages of congratulations - or good riddance.\"\n\nHe will be replaced by Vernon Kay in May, with Gary Davies presenting the 09:30-12:00 programme in the interim.\n\nIn his final message, Bruce also thanked the BBC, commenting: \"I've been here for a long time, and apart from the occasional vagary, it is still the finest broadcasting organisation in the world.\"\n\nHis workmates paid tribute to the long-serving presenter, with Jeremy Vine describing him as \"the most intelligent, generous and talented colleague\" and \"the presenter we all want to be like\".\n\nTravel reporter Richie Anderson said he was the \"kindest, warmest, friendliest person,\" telling him: \"Working with you has been a joy.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

But for the sake of 17 days, which was all that was remaining [on my contract], it seems a shame.\"\n\nBruce was originally due to complete his Radio ", "defends his behaviour in the interview with Chris Mason by suggesting that if \"subjective hurt feelings by some\" constitute bullying, then it will be very hard to ministers to get things done.\n\nRaab says he's sure he has made mistakes over the years, but the question is \"whether any of this amounted to bullying\".\n\nHe also denies that he accused civil servants of submitting \"woeful\" work, which the report concludes he did - but says even if he did, it wouldn't constitute bullying.\n\nQuote Message: But even in that scenario, if is not intentional, if it's not personalised, if actually it is right, but there are some subjective hurt feelings by some, I'm afraid that makes it very difficult to deliver. And it's not what you'd see in most walks of professional life.\u201d But even in that scenario, if is not intentional, if it's not personalised, if actually it is right, but there are some subjective hurt feelings by some, I'm afraid that makes it very difficult to deliver. And it's not what you'd see in most walks of professional life.\u201d\n\nRaab also argued that if the \"threshold for bullying is so lowered\", to the point where ministers cannot pick people up on bad work or identify where mistakes have been made \"ultimately it will be the public that pay the price\" in stymied reform.\n\nAsked if the report had made him reflect on his behaviour, Raab tells the BBC he didn't intend to upset anyone and that he has apologised if that was the case.Humza Yousaf says he only learned the party had no auditors after he won the SNP leadership\n\nThe SNP has signed a contract with a new auditor more than six months after the previous firm quit.\n\nThe SNP's Westminster group risks losing \u00a31.2m of public funding if it does not submit audited accounts by 31 May.\n\nGroup leader Stephen Flynn said he was now confident that the deadline would be met.\n\nThe party must also file its audited accounts with the Electoral Commission in July.\n\nHumza Yousaf, the SNP's leader and Scotland's first minister, said Manchester-based AMS Accountants Group had agreed to complete the accounts for both the party and its Westminster group.\n\nMr Yousaf said: \"There is hard work ahead but it is really encouraging to have them on board as we work towards challenging deadline\".\n\nIt emerged last month that the SNP's previous auditors, Johnston Carmichael, had quit last September.\n\nMr Yousaf has said he only found out after winning the contest to succeed Nicola Sturgeon in March that the party no longer had an accounting firm in place.\n\nA source told the BBC that Mr Yousaf, Mr Flynn and their teams had \"put in some shift to fix the situation they inherited\".\n\nThe source added: \"They have managed to turn things around in a matter of weeks and both the party and the Westminster group now have auditors in place.\"\n\nMr Flynn previously told the BBC that the party was having problems finding new auditors and that he could not guarantee it would be able to meet the 31 May deadline.\n\nHe also said the SNP was likely to lose \u00a31.2m of Short Money if it was not able to file its accounts by that date.\n\nShort Money is given to opposition parties to help them carry out their parliamentary work, and is based on how many MPs they have.\n\nHowever, Mr Flynn said on Wednesday that he was \"confident we'll meet the deadline, as in previous years\".\n\nMr Flynn was recently accused by his predecessor, Ian Blackford, of giving \"false assurances\" that a new auditor had been found - a claim that he dismissed.\n\nJohnston Carmichael, which had worked with the party for more than a decade, said the decision to stop auditing the SNP's accounts was taken after a review of its clients.\n\nPolice removed several boxes from the SNP's headquarters after searching the building last month\n\nIt comes amid an ongoing police investigation into the party's finances that saw Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell - who was until recently the SNP's chief executive - and former treasurer Colin Beattie being arrested last month.\n\nBoth men were released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nDetectives also spent two days searching Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell's home in Glasgow, and the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh as part of the inquiry.\n\nAnd a luxury motorhome which can sell for more than \u00a3100,000 was seized from outside the home of Mr Murrell's 92-year-old mother in Dunfermline, where it was said to have sat for more than two years.\n\nThere was a lingering note of caution from Humza Yousaf when he talked about the \"challenging\" deadlines facing his new auditors.\n\nBut the first minister will hope this is one less thing on his plate to worry about.\n\nHe would far rather be focusing on bread and butter issues of government, like the anti-poverty summit he convened this morning.\n\nBut there are still plenty of party matters cluttering his in-tray, and the opposition are only too keen to capitalise on them - as evidenced by the Holyrood debate this afternoon on \"the transparency of Scotland's governing party\".\n\nMr Yousaf's only option is to work through the items which he least has some control over. He has appointed new auditors, and launched an internal review of how his party is run.\n\nWhat may be of more concern are the issues which are out of his hands entirely - like the big unknown of the police investigation which continues to loom over the SNP.\n\nPolice Scotland launched its Operation Branchform investigation in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how more than \u00a3600,000 of donations from activists for a future independence referendum campaign were spent.\n\nQuestions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nIt also emerged that Mr Murrell had given the party a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 in June 2021 to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the previous month's Scottish Parliament election.\n\nAbout half of the loan had been repaid within a few months, but Mr Yousaf has said the party still owes money to Mr Murrell - although he has not yet said how much.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives are to push on Wednesday afternoon for the government to make a formal statement on the chaos that has engulfed the SNP since Ms Sturgeon stepped down as party leader and first minister.\n\nSpeaking ahead of a Holyrood debate on the issue, Tory leader Douglas Ross said the SNP's time in government had been characterised by \"unacceptable secrecy\" on a range of issues.\n\nAnd he claimed that the country's \"real priorities\" were being ignored by Mr Yousaf and his government because they are \"distracted by the meltdown in the party\".\n\nA similar call was previously rejected by the first minister, who said: \"I don't think parliament is the place to do a statement on the party's finances.\"\n\nThis latest attempt by the Conservatives is also likely to fail, with the SNP and their Scottish Green partners in government holding a majority of seats in the parliament.Last updated on .From the section Chelsea\n\nChelsea say a video clip of Conor Gallagher with a young black mascot has been \"taken considerably out of context\" and condemned the \"completely unacceptable\" abuse towards the player.\n\nIn the widely shared clip, Gallagher does not acknowledge a high five from the child in the tunnel before Saturday's 2-2 draw with Burnley.\n\nThe Blues captain, 24, then walks out with the child at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"It's [the abuse] upset me so much,\" said Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n\"No-one wants to do something like this, with this intention. I think he has many videos and photography with the mascots.\n\n\"When you play football, you are focusing to play, to start the game.\n\n\"I think people try to find things to create a mess and to abuse the people.\n\n\"I know Conor. I can speak for the people I know. Come on, that was never was his intention.\"\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's Premier League match against Manchester United, the Argentine said: \"Conor is a great, great kid, always caring about everything.\n\n\"I", "can, and they are still not doing whatever they can. Obviously, Hamas is not the best partner to negotiate with, but we want them back, and we want them back alive.\"\n\nNaama is pained by what Itai went through in his final months - witnessing the killing of his mother, Orit - a peace activist - on 7 October, and then languishing in captivity. And she's pained by a sense that Israel is getting used to the hostage crisis.\n\n\"I'm very worried about it,\" she tells me. \"I am worried about the nature of humankind to accept situations. I am disappointed from Israeli society. I am disappointed from the whole world that is sitting quiet and letting this happen.\"\n\nThen she leaves us to rejoin the marchers on the road to Jerusalem.\n\nDays later, relatives gather on the roadway at dusk - forming a tight circle of loss - and bringing traffic to a standstill outside Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv.\n\nMost carry posters with photos of sons, or daughters, or parents they have not seen or held since 7 October, when Hamas dragged them into Gaza.\n\nThen comes a sombre count (in Hebrew) \"one, two, three\" and onwards - a tally of the number of days their loved ones have been gone.\n\nThat number is now 163 (as of 17 March).\n\nEach word from the loudhailer resounds like an accusation directed at Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Signs read \"Deal refusal = Hostages' death sentence\".\n\nAmong the protesters we meet Amit Shem Tov, who wants his brother Omer back. He was taken from the music festival like Hersh Goldberg-Polin.\n\nAmit Shem Tov's brother, Omer, is among the hostages still believed to be in Gaza\n\n\"As beautiful as he is from the outside, he is more beautiful from the inside,\" Amit says, smiling at his brother's bearded face in the poster by his side, \"such a personality, too many friends, always making jokes, always laughs, always loves to dance, to live life. That's him\".\n\nThen the counting comes to an end, the few dozen protesters clear the road, and the traffic moves on - something the families of the hostages cannot do.\n\n\"For us, it's still 7 October,\" says Amit.Last updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nEngland's defence of their European title got off to a disappointing start at Wembley Stadium as they were held to a draw by Sweden in their first Euro 2025 qualifier.\n\nAlessia Russo nodded in Lauren James' clever cross in the first half but Sweden equalised through Fridolina Rolfo later on when she crept in behind Barcelona team-mate Lucy Bronze to head in at the back post.\n\nIt was an unconvincing performance from Sarina Wiegman's side, who have been drawn in a tough qualifying group with two of the world's top six and know they need to take advantage at home.\n\nIn a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final, in which England thrashed Sweden 4-0, this was a much more evenly balanced encounter with Sweden carrying great threat on the counter-attack.\n\nEngland's inability to control possession led to several chances, including a huge one for Arsenal striker Stina Blackstenius in the second half when she was played in behind the hosts' defence, only to shoot wide from close range.\n\nRolfo had earlier dragged a shot wide from another counter-attacking move and the Lionesses created very little - two very late efforts from Lauren Hemp and Beth Mead were their best chances of the match.\n\nEngland's qualification route is not easy - only the top two teams from their group qualify automatically for next summer's Euros in Switzerland, with the other two sides entering the play-offs.\n\nThey also face France, ranked third in the world, and they travel to Dublin on Tuesday to take on the Republic of Ireland (19:30 BST kick-off).\n\n\"Sweden are a very tough opponent. I do think we could have done a couple of things better,\" said England boss Wiegman afterwards.\n\n\"We want to learn from these games and do better every game as other countries want to do too. It shows how close and how tight our competition is.\"\n\nThe stadium announcer at Wembley welcomed England as the \"European champions here to defend their title\" with great enthusiasm - but it was not the exhilarating match many had hoped for.\n\nAn early challenge on Russo, which led to her needing medical attention for a cut to her shin, meant there was a lengthy stoppage and England took a while to find their rhythm afterwards.\n\nRusso's infamous backheel in the semi-final two years was in the memories of many fans as they headed to Wembley on Friday and she had her moment again but this time it was not enough to lift the crowd.\n\nPaper planes were thrown around the stands and fans shone their phone camera lights in the second half as the atmosphere dipped in correlation with England's performance.\n\nSloppy in possession and lacking creativity up front, this was not the vintage England that won Euro 2022.\n\nTheir task is to qualify from the toughest group on paper and this was not an ideal start, albeit against a strong Sweden side who will fancy themselves to go all the way in Switzerland next year.\n\nThe visitors were well organised in defence and strong in their press, with manager Peter Gerhardsson saying they had a plan to \"take away Keira Walsh\" and prevent the England midfielder from having an impact.\n\n\"The number one [plan] was to take away Keira Walsh and then you can disturb her,\" he said.\n\n\"It's more that we tried to press so their faces were down and they can't make the decisions. Today for our number 10, it was all about taking away Keira Walsh, but we will not play that way at home.\"\n\nIt was a moment of quality from James which teed up Russo's goal - a lovely, dinked cross from the right which the Arsenal striker only had to nod over the line - but Bronze's lapse in concentration, allowing Rolfo to creep in behind, proved costly.\n\nAt the venue the Lionesses lifted the trophy two years ago, this was not the same feeling at full-time as many left Wembley feeling deflated at an underwhelming start to the qualifying campaign.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

Issues dividing the countries include human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, territorial claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea and Beijing's growing domination of a host of industries.\n\nChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who was among", "had used before.\n\nThey praised an enormous team of opposition volunteers guarding ballot papers to ensure nothing untoward happened to the votes.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu, 74, has lost several elections as leader of his Republican People's Party, but this time his message of scrapping the president's excessive powers struck a chord.\n\nTurks have also been reeling from a cost-of-living crisis with 44% inflation, made only worse by Mr Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies. It was of little surprise that Turkey's Bist-100 stock market dropped 2.7% on Monday morning, and the Turkish lira fell back too.\n\nAnd then the Erdogan government was blamed for a slow rescue response to the double earthquakes in February which killed more than 50,000 people in 11 provinces.\n\nAnd yet, despite a very difficult few months, Turkey's dominant president appears to have the upper hand.\n\nOvernight results suggest the president's support in eight party strongholds hit by the earthquake dipped by just two to three points.\n\nIn seven of those eight cities, his support remained above 60%. Only in Gaziantep did it slip to 59%.\n\nAddressing supporters from the balcony he had used for previous victories he announced that \"even though the final results are not in, we are far ahead\".\n\nWhatever the margin between the two contenders ahead of the expected run-off in two weeks, the president appears to have defied many pollsters who said his rival had the edge and could even win outright without a run-off.\n\nHe is also heading for a majority in parliament, along with his nationalist MHP ally, according to unconfirmed results quoted by state news agency Anadolu. Of the 600 seats in parliament, the AKP and nationalist ally MHP have 316, it says.\n\nHis supporters ridiculed the opposition allies first for declaring that Mr Kilicdaroglu would become the 13th Turkish president, and then for gradually lowering their expectations as the night progressed.\n\nPro-Erdogan celebrations went on well into the night in the biggest city Istanbul\n\nWhat this result does confirm is the extent to which Turkish society has become polarised, 100 years since Kemal Ataturk's foundation of the modern Turkish republic.\n\nIn the final hours before voting began, Mr Kilicdaroglu rounded his campaign off with a trip to Ataturk's mausoleum in Ankara.\n\nPresident Erdogan instead chose to make a very symbolic statement to his conservative and nationalist support base, by making a campaign speech at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.\n\nUnder the Ottomans the former Orthodox Christian cathedral had become a mosque. Ataturk had turned it into a museum, but in 2020 Mr Erdogan turned it back into a mosque, defying international criticism.\n\nIt is unclear how close the expected run-off will be, and there is already considerable speculation over what will happen to the 5% of votes that went to the third candidate in the election, ultranationalist Sinan Ogan.\n\nHe knows both leaders will be trying to court him and has set some uncompromising conditions for the Kilicdaroglu camp, including the return of refugees to their original countries and \"fighting terrorism\".\n\nEven if he were to act as a kingmaker by endorsing one candidate or the other, it is far from certain that his first-round voters would follow his suggestion.Thousands of signal workers and maintenance staff in the RMT union have voted overwhelmingly to accept an offer from Network Rail to end its dispute.\n\nIt means they will not take part in any more strikes in the long-running dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions.\n\nRMT members who work for 14 train operating companies are still due to walk out on 30 March and 1 April.\n\nBut the Network Rail result will be seen as a significant breakthrough.\n\nRMT general secretary Mike Lynch said the offer had not been as high as he would have liked, but members had voted decisively to accept the deal.\n\n\"We're not pretending this is an overwhelming victory,\" he said. \"We're not celebrating the outcome, but we do accept our members' verdict that they have said 'this is enough'.\"\n\nThe turnout for the vote was nearly 90%, said the RMT, with 76% of members voting in favour of the pay offer.\n\nThe deal comes after Network Rail amended its previously rejected offer of a 5% pay rise for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.\n\nThe government did not put any more money on the table, but the tweaked proposals backdated this year's pay increase by three months, meaning workers end up with a bigger lump sum upfront.\n\nThe RMT - the country's biggest rail union - said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid.\n\nTransport secretary Mark Harper welcomed the \"resounding\" vote in favour of accepting the offer.\n\n\"I'm very pleased, on behalf of the travelling public, that at least on the Network Rail side of the rail business we've now solved the industrial disputes,\" he said.\n\nHe said Network Rail would proceed with the modernisation and maintenance reforms, that the RMT opposes.\n\nMr Harper said he hoped the deal would be followed by a vote amongst staff in dispute with the train operating companies, represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), who he said had made a \"fair and reasonable\" offer.\n\nMr Lynch said he would be meeting with RDG representatives on Tuesday, but that next week's strikes would still go ahead unless they received a \"cleaner deal\".\n\nThat should include more money and a dilution of some of the companies' demands, Mr Lynch said. The question of driver-only operated trains and the removal of ticket offices still had not been resolved, he added.\n\nWith a deal agreed at Network Rail, the disruption for passengers from future action will be on a slightly smaller scale, since maintenance and signalling staff will not be involved. It also means train operating companies that aren't directly involved in the dispute will be unaffected.\n\nDuring last Saturday's strike, workers at 14 train operators walked out, with between 40% and 50% of trains running.\n\nWorkers in various industries have held strikes, mainly over pay, which has not increased in line with rising prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at its highest in nearly four decades.RMT members are to stage a fresh strike on 2 June in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions.\n\nThe strike will see 20,000 train managers, caterers and station staff all walk off the job.\n\nThere will be three rail strikes within four days with Aslef train drivers walking out on 31 May and 3 June, the day of the FA Cup final.\n\nThe government said the RMT had gone \"out of their way\" to make life difficult for thousands.\n\nThe stoppages are also likely to cause disruption for many during the half term school break.\n\nThe RMT said no new proposals had been put forward by the train companies since the union's last strike action on 13 May.\n\nGeneral secretary Mick Lynch said the government was not allowing the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) to make an improved offer in the national dispute.\n\nIndustry negotiators were \"blindsided\" when the RMT turned down their latest offer in April. There was a war of words over whether the RDG had gone back on its proposals - something it strongly denied.\n\nOn Thursday, the train companies' group said it had continued to stand by its \"fair\" proposal, and said the RMT leadership had chosen to \"to prolong this dispute without ever giving their members a chance to have a say on their own offer\".\n\nAslef's walkouts are now more disruptive than the RMT's, because settling the separate Network Rail dispute in March means signalling staff are no longer involved.\n\nHowever, RMT members have backed strike action potentially into the Autumn.\n\nThe government and industry argue the railway is financially unsustainable, and working practices need to change to enable a pay rise.\n\nUnions argue jobs and conditions are being attacked and the wage increases on the table are far below inflation.\n\n\"Ministers cannot just wish this dispute away,\" the RMT's Mick Lynch said.\n\nOn Thursday the government called again for the union to allow its members to have a vote on what it described as the \"fair and reasonable offer\" tabled", "words just what an impact she has had not just on the SNP, the cause of independence but on the country as a whole.\n\n\"She is immortalised in our party and our movement.\"\n\nOther attendees included former Scottish government finance secretaries John Swinney and Derek Mackay, as well as ex-health secretary Jeane Freeman.\n\nScottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross was also at the service and said that Mrs Ewing had served the Highlands well during her time as a parliamentarian.\n\nWinnie Ewing's children Annabelle and Fergus, both SNP MSPs, were at the service\n\nHe added: \"She was a trailblazer not just for the independence movement but also for women in politics.\"\n\nAs well as serving in both the UK and Scottish Parliaments, Mrs Ewing was also a member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1999, becoming known as Madame Ecosse and being given the title Mother of the European Parliament.\n\nIn July 2001, she announced her intention to stand down as a list MSP for the Highlands and Islands ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections.\n\nMrs Ewing is survived by three children and four grandchildren.\n\nMrs Ewing became known as Madame Ecosse during her time as a Member of the European ParliamentImogen's mother Rachel was 22 weeks and five days pregnant when she gave birth\n\nA baby given less than a 10% chance of surviving when she was born at 22 weeks has beaten the odds and is thriving, her parents have said.\n\nImogen weighed 515g (1lb 1oz) when she was born at Swansea's Singleton Hospital on 6 September.\n\nNow, after 132 days in hospital, the six-month-old is back home in Bridgend.\n\nHer mother Rachel Stonehouse, 28, said: \"Imogen has gone through so much and more than we will ever go through in our lifetime and she smashed it.\"\n\nThe world's most premature surviving baby is thought to be Curtis Zy-Keith Means from the USA, born at 21 weeks and one day, 11 days earlier than Imogen.\n\nRachel initially went to Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital, just days after the gender reveal party for Imogen, with a bleed before her waters broke and she and her partner Corey were taken by ambulance to Singleton Hospital.\n\n\"It was so scary,\" she said.\n\n\"The pain was horrendous... I just went into survival mode for me and my baby and tried to just keep breathing through the pain.\"\n\nRachel said when Imogen was born she was smaller than her hand\n\nImogen was delivered just minutes after arriving at the hospital and was immediately placed in a bag in an incubator to mimic the womb.\n\nRachel said seeing her new, tiny baby in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and taking in her extremely fragile and translucent image was \"like an out-of-body experience\".\n\nShe said she remembered thinking: \"This baby should be in my stomach but she's not. This foetus is now my baby in front of me and I now have to trust all these people around me.\"\n\nRachel and Corey were told their baby had a grade three bleed on the brain.\n\nAfter 98 days in NICU in Swansea, Imogen was moved to the Princess of Wales Hospital\n\nOver the 98 days she spent in NICU she overcame countless obstacles, including a heart murmur, a pulmonary haemorrhage, sepsis and numerous blood transfusions.\n\n\"She was poked and prodded all day, every day but I had to remember this was to make her better,\" said Rachel.\n\nMidwives helped Rachel to express colostrum and with their help she was able provide breast milk for Imogen until it dried up at about 16 weeks.\n\nThe hospital housed the couple nearby for 13 weeks to make sure they could be with Imogen as much as possible and offered post-traumatic stress disorder counselling.\n\nOn 15 January, Imogen was moved to the special care baby unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital where she spent a further 34 days.\n\nAfter 132 days in hospital, it was finally home time for the family\n\n\"It was the scariest time of my life but I would never know it because of how amazing the staff has been with me and my family. They always trusted me as a mum and my instincts.\"\n\nImogen is now home, but still requires oxygen and Rachel said doctors were happy with her organs and she has no sight or hearing problems.\n\nRachel said the reason she went into premature labour was unclear, but she has been told she has a 40% chance of it happening again.\n\nFor now she is loving every minute of being a new mum and said she would be forever grateful to the NHS.\n\n\"When they say these nurses and doctors are superheroes in scrubs they are not lying,\" she said.\n\n\"We wouldn't have got through everything we have without them all.\"\n\u2022 None Twins thought to be UK's most premature to surviveConservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said work at the site was being \"smeared\"\n\nThe government is setting up an independent panel to probe claims of \"corruption, wrongdoing and illegality\" at the UK's largest industrial zone.\n\nLevelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he had taken the \"exceptional decision\" to order the review into claims at the Teesworks site in Redcar.\n\nLabour MPs had raised concerns over the transfer of millions of pounds of public assets to private developers.\n\nTees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he \"looked forward\" to its outcome.\n\nIn a letter to Conservative Mr Houchen, Mr Gove said he was acting on a request from the mayor and had \"reflected carefully on the choices available\".\n\nHe said the \"continued allegation of corruption\" had posed a \"very real risk\" to the site, which had \"delivered jobs and economic growth\".\n\nHowever he said, although it was not in the National Audit Office's (NAO) remit to investigate the site, he would \"welcome\" the body to update \"its review of the government's funding arrangements\".\n\nMichael Gove said an independent panel would be set up\n\nMr Gove said he would ask a independent panel to report on the governance arrangements, how decisions are made, and look \"at the value achieved for the investment of public money on the site\".\n\nHe said he would \"invite\" interested parties, including MPs, to make representations as part of \"evidence\".\n\nMr Houchen said the review was necessary to \"show investors\" that there had been no wrongdoing.\n\n\"My officers stand ready to provide any and all information requested by the independent review,\" he said.\n\nAbout 20,000 employees will be working on the site, officials have said\n\nLabour's shadow secretary for Levelling Up Lisa Nandy previously said there were \"serious questions\" that \"remained unanswered\" and had called for an investigation.\n\nIt followed reports publicly-owned land, potentially worth millions of pounds at the former steel works site were handed to private investors for \u00a3100.\n\nReacting to news of the investigation, Ms Nandy said: \"This is bizarre.

He said he hoped two-way traffic could be restored by mid-September.\n\nRussia's transport ministry says the bridge's supports were not damaged in the attack, which ruptured the span.\n\nThe Kerch Bridge was opened in 2018 and enables road and rail travel between Russia and Crimea - Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014 after an internationally unrecognised referendum.\n\nThe bridge's parallel railway line seems not to have been damaged.\n\nUkraine has not officially said it carried out the attack but a source in its security service told BBC Russian it was behind it and that water-based drones had been used.\n\nAs yet, the BBC not seen any visual evidence to confirm the reports.\n\nThe bridge is an important resupply route for Russian forces occupying parts of southern Ukraine since they invaded on 24 February of last year.\n\nA video on Deputy PM's Marat Khusnullin's telegram appears to show cars crossing the Kerch bridge\n\nRussian holidaymakers leaving a train which crossed the Kerch Bridge on Monday\n\nThe new attack is the second major incident on the Kerch Bridge in the past year.\n\nIn October the bridge was partially closed following an attack.

Both sides rested their case on Thursday, though Mr Trump's team called no witnesses in his defence.\n\nHe had told reporters he might cut his ongoing golf trip to Ireland short to \"confront\" Ms Carroll in court.\n\n\"I'll be going back early because a woman made a claim that is totally false, it's fake,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nE Jean Carroll said the alleged attack left her unable to have a romantic life\n\nMr Trump's suggestion that he would return to New York comes after his lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, told the judge Mr Trump would not testify in court.\n\nReferring to Mr Trump's comments, the judge said he would give Mr Trump until Sunday afternoon to decide. After that, the judge said, \"that ship has irrevocably sailed\".\n\nThe nine-member jury was shown the video of a combative deposition between the former president and Roberta Kaplan, one of Ms Carroll's lawyers, filmed last October.\n\nMr Trump continued his emphatic denials of Ms Carroll's accusation, that Mr Trump manoeuvred her into a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan and raped her.\n\n\"If it did happen, it would have been reported within minutes,\" Mr Trump said in the deposition, suggesting that others at the \"very busy store\" would have heard an ongoing attack.\n\nJurors in the nearly two-week trial heard days of graphic testimony. Ms Carroll told jurors she was left \"unable to ever have a romantic life again\" after the alleged attack.\n\nMarla Maples was married to Mr Trump from 1993 until 1999\n\nHer account was supported in court by her friend, Lisa Birnbach, who testified this week to receiving a call from Ms Carroll minutes after she says she was raped.\n\nAnd two other women - Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff - were called by Ms Carroll's team and described alleged sexual assaults committed by Mr Trump - claims he has denied.\n\nA former columnist for Elle magazine, Ms Carroll was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\n\nThe act allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state over claims that would have normally exceeded statute limitations.Last updated on .From the section Athletics\n\nJust Stop Oil says it will \"continue disrupting cultural and sporting events\" amid concerns protestors will target the London Marathon on Sunday.\n\nLondon Marathon race director Hugh Brasher said that he has received \"unique\" assurances from Extinction Rebellion over their planned protest.\n\nBut, in an interview with the BBC, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson would not rule out disrupting the event.\n\nIndigo Rumbelow said London Marathon runners \"want what Just Stop Oil want\".\n\nShe added the climate activism group's disruption would continue \"until the institutions of this country pick a side\".\n\nA protester wearing a T-shirt in support of Just Stop Oil halted play at the World Snooker Championship on Monday after climbing on to a table and covering it in orange powder.\n\nMore than 45,000 runners are expected to take part in Sunday's race around London, which raised more than \u00a358m for charities in 2022.\n\n\"What marathon runners want is clean air, a healthy family and dinner on the table. I want to be clear that that is what Just Stop Oil wants too,\" Rumbelow said.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Thursday, British distance running great Mo Farah, who will compete in Sunday's event, said he \"trusts\" the London Marathon to handle any disruption.\n\n\"On Sunday people want to see the best athletes go out there and put on a show,\" Farah said.\n\n\"For us as athletes, we just have to go out there and concentrate on what we're doing.

This includes:\n\nThe Renfrewshire Council review led by independent consultant David Bowles recommends local school catchment areas are reconsidered and the council's pupil forecast model continues to be revised.\n\nLocal parent Alan Kelly says the report highlights \"unimaginable failings within Renfrewshire Council\"\n\nLocal parent Alan Kelly, a former chairman of the school's parent council, said: \"The report uses the word incompetent more than once and it notes that numerous legitimate concerns expressed by parents were brushed aside.\n\n\"Disappointingly it doesn't touch on failures since October, 2022, and doesn't consider the roles of the current council leadership team.\n\n\"The council have again let us down - still no land for the new school, still no plan, nothing in place.\"\n\nRenfrewshire Council is in talks with with landowners BAE about securing a site for a new primary school in Dargavel, capable of accommodating 800 pupils, which would cost up to \u00a345m.\n\nIn addition, an expansion of Park Mains High School in Erskine, to accommodate 400 extra pupils, would also be required and this has an estimated cost of up to \u00a330m.\n\nThe council's chief executive Alan Russell said he was \"deeply sorry for the very serious historic mistakes made over a prolonged period\" and the \"understandable distress caused to local communities in the area.\".\n\nHe added: \"This is a very difficult report for the council and will be equally upsetting for the Dargavel community.\n\n\"I fully acknowledge the review findings and accept all its recommendations.\n\n\"Detailed work is progressing at pace to increase pupil capacity and to improve our processes and procedures.\"\n\nA BAE Systems spokesperson said: \"Whilst we've fulfilled our planning obligations for primary education by delivering a new school in 2021 and providing land for a nursery, we continue to work proactively with Renfrewshire Council, over and above these obligations, to support its revised strategy for local primary education provision.\"We recognise the importance of this issue for the residents of Dargavel village and have identified potential areas of the development to Renfrewshire Council which could be used to deliver its additional primary education requirements.\"Coal extraction at Merthyr Tydfil's Ffos-y-Fran mine began in 2007 on a 15-year licence\n\nThe UK's largest opencast coalmine must close after an extension to keep it running was rejected.\n\nIt means production at Ffos-y-Fran, near Merthyr Tydfil, must now stop after 16 years of excavation.\n\nThe operators asked for an extension until 2024, arguing coal from the mine was needed by the steel industry.\n\nBut planning officials advised that the proposed extension did not fit with Welsh government policies on tackling climate change.\n\nThe Ffos-y-Fran land reclamation scheme won planning permission in 2005 and work began two years later to excavate 11 million tonnes of coal across a site the size of 400 football pitches.\n\nThe other aim was to restore the land - riddled with the remains of old industries - back to green hillside for the community's benefit as work progressed.\n\nBut there was stiff opposition due to the mine's proximity to homes and businesses.\n\nThe closest houses were initially less than 40m (132ft) away, and residents led a long campaign, saying their lives were being blighted by coal dust and noise.\n\nCampaigners outside the public meeting, including Alyson Austin, were thrilled with the result\n\nBook keeper Alyson Austin, 59, of Bradley Gardens, Merthyr Tydfil, said: \"I'm ecstatic and I am furious with the local authority for wasting all this time.\n\n\"They have had the powers to take enforcement action and they haven't used them.\n\n\"I'm not confident about it being restored. That is another fight.\n\n\"But today we won. Today the message has gone out: No more coal in Wales.\"\n\nMs Austin's husband Chris said he was \"over the moon\" but the 67-year-old is now concerned about the future of the site, which he called \"a scar on the mountain side\".\n\nThe retired software worker was worried about the cost of repairing the land, estimated at \u00a375m-\u00a3125m, and feared the company would \"walk away\".\n\nHe said: \"That cost would bankrupt this authority.\"\n\nPhilip Hughes says coal has no place in Wales' future\n\nRetired retailer Philip Hughes, 59, of Carmarthen, said: \"It's excellent news. Coal mining has got to stop.\n\n\"Climate change is such a massive issue for the planet. [The mine] has to close as soon as possible and action should be taken to close it.\"\n\nFriends of the Earth Cymru director Haf Elgar said she felt a \"big sense of relief\".\n\nShe added: \"This sets a strong precedent about any more coal coming from Wales.\"\n\nCoal Action Network campaigner Anne Harris, 38, travelled from Lancaster to be at the meeting.\n\nShe compared standing at the bottom of Ffos y Ffran to \"standing in the belly of a slaughtered beast\".\n\nShe said she was unsurprised by the apparent gap in the restoration fund, but was \"ecstatic\" with the result of the meeting, saying: \"This community has suffered for too long.\"\n\nProtests held in this long-running saga even attracted the support of the United Nations' top legal expert on the human rights of communities affected by pollution in 2017.\n\nThe mine itself always rejected the claims, arguing that it was heavily regulated and provides well-paid jobs in an area that badly needed them.\n\nAfter 15 years, planning permission ran out in September 2022 - but the company in charge applied for an extension.\n\nMerthyr (South Wales) Ltd wanted to be allowed to keep coal mining until the end of March 2024 and push back the date for final restoration of the site to June 2026.\n\nWelsh government coal policy prevents the development of new mines or extensions to existing ones apart from in \"wholly exceptional circumstances\".\n\nAn aerial view of Ffos-y-Fran opencast coal mine in November 2021\n\nThe company argued it qualified, claiming to have a role of \"national importance\" in supplying the Port Talbot steelworks.\n\nBut it also admitted that \"insufficient funds\" had been set aside to complete the restoration of the land as envisaged back in 2005, and time was needed to put forward and consult on a revised plan.\n\nPlanning consultant Huw Towns told the hearing \"there is a very real risk that one of the substantial benefits of the scheme will not be delivered\".\n\nCouncillor after councillor made speeches saying they rejected the proposals, to applause and cheers from the packed public gallery.\n\nCouncillor Declan Salmon said residents were left \"with more questions than answers - what a mess this has been from the very", "Macron was greeted with an elaborate military parade outside the Great Hall of the People\n\nFrench leader Emmanuel Macron has urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help stop Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses, and bring everyone back to the negotiating table,\" he told Mr Xi in Beijing.\n\nMr Xi said China and France had the \"ability and responsibility\" to safeguard world peace.\n\nBut Moscow said there were \"no prospects for a peaceful settlement\" so far and its offensive would continue.\n\nMr Macron is on a state visit to China that is being highly scrutinised after years of deteriorating relations between the West and China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Macron is also seeking to bolster trade ties. He is joined by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who he invited to take part in talks with the Chinese leadership, as well as a large business delegation.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Mr Macron was treated to an elaborate military parade in Beijing, before entering closed-door talks with Mr Xi, which Chinese and French officials described as \"frank\" and \"friendly\".\n\nSpeaking to the press afterwards, Mr Xi said \"China advocates for peace talks and seeks a political solution\", and called for \"rational restraint\" from the international community.\n\nHe also reiterated that nuclear weapons should not be used in the conflict. Russia said earlier this week it planned to place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, near the ally's western border with Nato countries.\n\nMr Macron said \"we can't have a safe and stable Europe\" as long as Ukraine remained occupied, and that it was \"unacceptable\" that a member of the UN Security Council had violated the organisation's charter.\n\nThe French leader struck a cordial tone in his speech, often turning to Mr Xi during the press conference and addressing him directly. It stood in contrast to Mr Xi's impassive delivery to the press.\n\nIn a separate press conference later, Ms von der Leyen stressed that if China provided arms to Russia, it would be against international law and \"significantly harm\" the relationship between the EU and China.\n\nShe also said she expected Beijing to play a role that \"promotes a just peace\", and that she stood \"firmly\" behind Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky's peace plan - which calls for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops.\n\nChina has released its own peace plan which Western nations have been generally dismissive of, saying it sides too much with Russia. But Mr Zelensky has expressed interest in it and called for direct talks with Mr Xi - who has yet to publicly respond.\n\nBut Ms von der Leyen said during her discussion with Mr Xi he \"reiterated willingness\" to speak with Mr Zelensky \"when the conditions and timing are right\".\n\nOn Thursday, Russia acknowledged that China has \"a very effective and commanding potential for mediation\".\n\n\"But the situation with Ukraine is complex, so far there are no prospects for a peaceful settlement,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who added that Russia had \"no choice\" but to continue with the war.\n\nMr Macron is being hosted at a state dinner on Thursday night, and on Friday the two will travel to the southern city of Guangzhou where they will dine again together privately.\n\nThe trip marks the most politically significant interaction Mr Xi has had with a Western leader since he met US President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in Bali last November.\n\nWith this visit Mr Macron, who has been keen to burnish his credentials as an international peace broker, has now had personal contact with all the major players in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nObservers believe he knows he is unlikely to come back from this China trip with any major diplomatic achievement to boast of. The chances of Mr Xi changing his views on Russia and Ukraine in any significant way are, to say the least, small.\n\nMr Macron is likely to emphasise small advances, points in common, and the benefits of engagement through trade and talks.\n\nHe is said to believe that just because France is part of the Western alliance, and close to the US, does not mean it cannot deepen its relations with China which is allied to Russia.\n\nIn his remarks to the press, the French leader mentioned little of China's human rights issues - a perennial point of contention between China and the West - but said that while they remain important to France, \"it's better to be respectful than to lecture\".\n\nMr Macron's trip also saw several significant deals signed by French and Chinese corporations and cultural institutions, witnessed by him and Mr Xi.\n\nHe is travelling with a delegation comprising business leaders, artists and museum officials. They include top executives from plane manufacturer Airbus, luxury group LVMH, and nuclear energy producer EDF.\n\nThe trip to Beijing, four years after Mr Macron last paid a visit to Mr Xi, takes place during strikes and unrest in France over unpopular reforms of the pension system.Marks & Spencer has become the latest retailer to scrap use-by dates on milk as part of efforts to cut food waste.\n\nThe dates, which are meant to tell customers when food is safe to eat, will be replaced by best-before dates instead, which are recommendations on freshness.\n\nThe supermarket chain urged customers to use their judgement on whether the milk is safe to use.\n\nMilk is among the foods that are thrown away the most by UK households, alongside bread and potatoes, according to environmental charity Wrap.\n\nIt said nearly 490 million pints are wasted each year, and the \"main reason is not drinking before the use-by date\".\n\nM&S said better shelf-life and improvements in milk quality meant consumers could use \"their judgement on what's still good to eat\" without having to rely on labels.\n\nThe changes to labelling on M&S Select Farms British and organic fresh milk will come into effect this week.\n\nRival retailer Morrisons said in January it would get rid of use-by dates on 90% of its own-brand milk and encourage its customers to \"use a sniff test\".\n\nThat followed a similar move by dairy giant Arla in 2019.\n\nAccording to food regulators, whether milk needs a use-by date depends on how much it has been processed.\n\nFood businesses should assess the \"microbiological risk\" before deciding whether to apply a use-by date or best before date, the Food Standards Agency said.\n\nIt warned that a \"sniff test\" is not always reliable.\n\n\"People can't always smell the bugs that cause food poisoning,\" it said in 2022.\n\nIt advised against consuming milk after a specified use-by date \"even if it smells fine\".\n\nHowever, milk with a best before date label \"can be sniffed to see if it has gone bad,\" it said.\n\nPeople who have a problem with their sense of smell should get someone else to check it, or not use the milk after the best-before date, it added.\n\nSupermarkets have been ditching use-by dates on fruit and vegetables to help reduce food waste for a number of years.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.\n\nThis year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate.\n\nRegiments that played a key role in the war will parade in front of the top brass and the president, whose address will echo across Red Square and be scrutinised for what to expect next. Russia's leader often uses this moment to send messages of intent.\n\nThe Victory Day parade was occasionally marked in the Soviet era and revived by President Boris Yeltsin for the 50th anniversary in 1995, but it was Vladimir Putin in 2008 who made it an annual event featuring military hardware. Russian identity has been largely created with Victory Day in the background, with schoolbooks and history books focusing on Russia as Europe's wartime liberators.\n\nVladimir Putin was prime minister when the Victory Day parade began featuring military hardware\n\n\"Even in a normal year it's a huge show of Russia strength, of Putin's control and everything he stands for,\" says Ammon Cheskin of Glasgow University. \"And that's just amplified this year.\"\n\nClaims that he will declare an end to the campaign have been denied, as have reports that he will announce a full declaration of war or a mobilisation of Russian men. Russia's military would not \"artificially adjust\" its actions to any particular date, said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nSomething short of full mobilisation could be announced, in response to Russia's big losses on the battlefield. Dozens of ads have appeared on job websites in recent weeks looking for \"specialists in mobilisation work\", but such a step could hit the president's popularity and 9 May might not be the right time to announce it.\n\nAfter Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Vladimir Putin marked Victory Day with a speech in Red Square about defeating fascism, before flying to the Black Sea port of Sevastopol to celebrate his new victory in front of thousands of onlookers.\n\nIn 2014, President Putin celebrated the annexation of Crimea by travelling to Sevastopol on Victory Day\n\n\"This year the primary objective was to announce the victory that was supposed to happen in February,\" says Ernest Wyciszkiewicz of the Centre for Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understanding. \"They are preparing a PR stunt for Monday: it's important for Russians to see that the special military operation they have been hearing about has led to something tangible.\"\n\nInstead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of \"de-Nazification and demilitarisation\" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two.\n\n\"In Russian cities and regional capitals we can see signs with the Victory Day symbol,\" says Olga Irisova, co-founder of analysis group Riddle Russia. \"Usually the signs say 9 May 1945 but this year it's 1945/2022", "Then I wouldn't have to look at it every morning\".\n\nSuzanne Cumpston, of Cowbridge's Sam Smith Travel, said: \"Can't help thinking this is an out-of-date April fool.\"\n\nThe town council posted on Instagram: \"Cowbridge Town Council are aware of a story in the press regarding a statue outside of The Bear Hotel.\n\n\"The council has not received notification of any planning applications for the statue.\"\n\nH has been an independent member of Cowbridge with Llanblethian Town Council since 2023\n\nThe council's deputy town clerk, Clair Davis, believed it was an \"April fool's prank published too late\".\n\nIt was, she added, \"absolutely nothing to do with us\".\n\n\"I've spoken to a lady from Vale of Glamorgan council and she has received a complaint about it because of a statue being placed in the middle of Cowbridge,\" Ms Davis said.\n\nNeither was Ms Davis aware of Cultural Cowbridge.\n\n\"We've Googled them and cannot come up with anything,\" she said.\n\nA Vale of Glamorgan council spokesman said: \"I think it was an April fool.\"\n\nH has been approached for comment, and no contact details could be found for Cultural Cowbridge to ask for one.\n\nOn Friday morning, comedian Lycett hinted the whole thing was a wind-up for his show Late Night Lycett.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 2's Breakfast show, he said: \"There's a game we're going to play for the next week, there's a lot of fake news about designed to polarise and set us apart. I was thinking what can I do about that, I can't change an entire media landscape.\n\n\"What realise I can do is be silly. For the last month, I've been seeding silly fake news, ridiculous and stupid stories into the press to see if they can push out those polarising stories and take up that space.\n\n\"We've had loads of hits, and multiple news stories, fake news stories in the news right now and in the last month.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was behind the H statue, he said he \"couldn't possibly say\".Prince Harry seemed to grow in confidence during the second day of his court appearance\n\nIt might have been the sense of relief, but there was an emotion-packed pause before Prince Harry answered one of his final questions in the witness box.\n\n\"You have had to go through these articles and answer questions knowing this is a very public courtroom and the world's media are watching. How has that made you feel?\" Prince Harry was asked by his barrister at the end of his court appearance in the case against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).\n\nAfter a day and a half of giving evidence at London's High Court, he looked exhausted and the pause got longer.\n\n\"It's a lot,\" was all he said in the end, sounding distinctly choked up.\n\nIn the witness box over the course of two days he had spoken quietly, often in terse, quickfire answers, interspersed with some nervous quips - \"if you say so\", he said a few times ironically to some details being presented to him.\n\nHe has accused the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People of hacking and illegal information-gathering.\n\nThe great majority of his time in court has been facing questions from the Mirror Group's barrister, Andrew Green, an interrogator with a reputation fearsome enough for him to be known as a \"beast in court\".\n\nBut in the end, it was quite possibly Prince Harry who will have left the court feeling better about the last couple of days. He'd finished his high-wire act without falling off.\n\nHe hadn't crumbled or got wound up or tetchy, he hadn't been dragged into too many awkward questions, he'd stuck to his own lines. You couldn't exactly say he'd been an eloquent witness, but he'd not walked into any traps.\n\n\"For my whole life the press has misled me and covered up the wrongdoing,\" he claimed.\n\nHe talked of how paranoid it had made him. In evidence he said he'd never walk down a London street. But he wouldn't even walk around this court building with its airport-style scanning checks, going everywhere within a bubble of security guards. A guard had stood across the doorway as he went into the toilet.\n\nBut when the hearing was over, Prince Harry looked relieved and relaxed, chatting to his lawyers and those backing him in his battle against the tabloids, before heading downstairs to his waiting car.\n\nThe Mirror's barrister had aimed to punch some big holes in the prince's claims - saying that just because Harry had faced a lifetime of press intrusion, that didn't mean that this specific newspaper group had hacked his phones or done anything unlawful to him.\n\nHe argued that a number of these disputed news stories hadn't even originated with the Mirror's papers, they'd already been published elsewhere or had been based on press releases, rather than by unlawful surveillance.\n\nBut as the hearing progressed it felt like Prince Harry was growing in confidence, his wrist bands on show as he looked at the computer screens on his desk with the evidence under discussion.\n\nFor such an historic event, the first senior royal in the witness box for over a century, it was a low-key setting, a modern open-plan court that was more budget airport departure lounge than mahogany-filled courtroom.\n\nThere was also a sense of history about some of the pun-tastic tabloid articles under discussion.\n\nFor younger audiences it must have seemed like journalistic archaeology, these inky front pages and half-forgotten celebrities. You couldn't search for some of these stories now, because they were published before Google was even invented.\n\nWhile Prince Harry has talked about his \"life's work\" being to change the media landscape, technology has already done much of the work for him.\n\nWhen some of these stories were being published 20 years ago, the Daily Mirror was selling 2 million copies a day, while the most recent ABC circulation figures show sales of about 280,000.\n\nSince the era of these phone hacking claims, mobile phones and digital news have chipped away at the world of the tabloids.\n\nThere was also a sense from his emotional testimony that Prince Harry is still slightly trapped in these tabloid years, making him seem younger than he really is. He's only five years younger than the prime minister, but Harry in the public eye is still somehow remembered as the younger brother mourning the loss of his mother.\n\nThis unprecedented appearance in the High Court also showed how for the prince the blurring between private and public life must be a very strange experience.\n\nWe've spent two days looking at stories chronicling his life in headlines. And when he entered the court building he'd have walked past a photo and a video of his late grandmother, who opened this building. The Dieu et Mon Droit symbol in the courtroom is the motto of the monarch, his father.\n\nBut during this court appearance he also explained precisely why he was really here - why he was bringing this legal action, when previous royals had fought shy of facing questions in court.\n\nIt was a deliberate attempt to find a different course of action \"to stop the abuse, intrusion and hate that was coming towards me and my wife\".\n\nRather than the longstanding royal policy of \"don't complain, don't explain\", he has taken the higher-risk strategy of going into battle in the courtroom.\n\nIt's also an unexpected journey that has seen him making comments a long way from the usual royal political neutrality. In his written statement he seemed to be wading into the culture war with a swipe at a \"rock-bottom\" government.\n\nIt will be up to the judge to decide on balance who seems to be more convincing, the Mirror Group or Prince Harry and other claimants - and it's quite possible that the result won't be known until the autumn.\n\nIf he FaceTimes his family in California, as he said yesterday, it might be more relaxed this evening.\n\nBut given the number of other legal claims involving Prince Harry, this could be the first of a number of courtroom appearances. From the royal court to the law court.Police officers in England will no longer respond to concerns about mental health if there is no risk to life or crime being committed, under new plans.\n\nThe government says the policy could save a million hours of police time every year.\n\nSenior officers say forces have \"lost their way\" by dealing with less serious mental health problems.\n\nBut mental health charities say they are \"deeply worried\" at what could be a \"dangerous\" change.\n", "Italian has largely impressed following his move from Empoli last June and made more crucial saves here - flying to his left for a two-handed stop from a James Ward-Prowse first-half free-kick and then denying Antonio twice after the break.\n\nBut corners remain a weakness which he and Spurs must address.\n\nManager David Moyes will have wanted a response from West Ham after the galling 4-3 defeat at Newcastle, having been two goals ahead with 15 minutes remaining. Despite the early goal conceded, his team delivered.\n\n\"I genuinely thought we didn't deserve to go behind,\" Moyes told TNT Sports. \"But the players did a good job.\n\n\"We had a threat and so did they - they are a good side and that's why they are challenging for the Champions League. Maybe a draw was the right result in the end.\n\n\"I'm sure after the way we played on the weekend, to see the way the defence played [here], we looked much more organised. We had set-pieces, we had chances, so overall hopefully it will give us good confidence.\"\n\nThings had looked positive when Mohammed Kudus pressed high to win the ball back near the Spurs area, before crossing from the left for Bowen to fire wide from a good position.\n\nSeconds later the Hammers switched off in defence and Spurs led, another example of the frailties which have frustrated fans in this campaign.\n\nMoyes' men have now conceded 55 league goals this season, the same number as they lost during the whole of 2022-23, and are without a clean sheet in 11 matches.\n\nBut there is clearly some fire in this West Ham side, sparked by the inspirational Bowen, who raised a taunting fist in defiance at the away fans after delivering the dead-ball routine for Zouma's equaliser.\n\nThe hosts went on to create the better chances, but could not find the winner.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

Eyedrops that are made in India and imported to the US under two brands were subsequently pulled from shelves in January and February.\n\nIn January, the CDC warned people to stop using EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma's Artificial Tears. The next month, the company that owns the brands - Global Pharma - issued a voluntary recall following a formal recommendation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nOpened bottles taken from patients were found through testing to contain the bacteria, the CDC said. Unopened bottles are currently being tested to determine whether contamination occurred during the manufacturing process.\n\nLast week, a woman in Florida sued the drug company, claiming that an infection she suffered after using their product forced doctors to remove one of her eyes.\n\nA lawyer for the woman blamed the contamination on a lack of preservatives in the eyedrops.\n\n\"There's likely many more people who have suffered infections who are unaware,\" lawyer Natasha Cortes told NBC News.\n\nA representative for EzriCare has said that testing so far has not definitively linked the outbreak to their products.\n\n\"To the greatest extent possible, we have been contacting customers to advise them against continued use of the product,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"We also immediately reached out to both CDC and FDA and indicated our willingness to cooperate with any requests they have of us.\"\n\nThe CDC said that anyone who has used the recalled products and are now experiencing symptoms should contact a doctor.\n\nSymptoms include yellow, green, or clear discharge from the eye, discomfort or pain, redness, blurry vision and increase sensitivity to light.\n\nLast week, the FDA published separate recall notices for some eyedrop products distributed by Pharmedica and Apotex after the companies said they voluntarily pulled them from shelves.\n\nEyedrops and eyewash products were used by approximately 117 million Americans in 2020, according to Statista, a market research firm.\n\u2022 None Global Pharma Healthcare Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Artificial Tears Lubricant Eye Drops Due to Possible Contamina The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.The last edition of Big Issue North will be on sale from 8 May\n\nThe northern version of Big Issue is to cease publication in May with the charity blaming declining town centre footfall and rising costs.\n\nBig Issue North was \"no longer financially viable\" but it was an \"incredibly hard decision\", the magazine management said.\n\nVendors in the North will sell Big Issue UK to earn an income.\n\nThe publication focussed on regional stories and was independently produced in Manchester for 30 years.\n\nThe magazine said a decline in sales in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic \"as town centre footfall decreased, alongside increased print, energy and paper costs, mean that continuing to produce Big Issue North is no longer financially viable\".\n\nThe charity will instead employ a northern correspondent, to publish stories via the Street News app and its social and web channels, as well as offering content to Big Issue UK.\n\nThe publication began its northern version in 1993\n\nFay Selvan, CEO of Big Issue North, said: \"We could not be prouder of the impact that the magazine has had, both in giving marginalised people a chance to work their way out of poverty, and in the stories we have told from our communities.\"\n\nShe said a \"number of alternatives\" had been explored, but \"ceasing production and offering the national Big Issue magazine to vendors in the North is the route that gives the best possible opportunity for the most people to earn an income and change their lives\".\n\nShe added the \"incredibly hard decision\" was not taken \"lightly\".\n\nEditor of the magazine, Kevin Gopal, said it was a \"sad moment for independent northern-based publishing and a sign of the difficult commercial outlook for much of the media industry\".\n\n\"Hopefully we've done good journalism and helped vendors.

Justin Levene said the airport couldn't provide an adequate wheelchair last August\n\nThe image is shocking: Justin Levene, a paraplegic man, dragging himself along the floor through Luton Airport after his self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight.\n\nAs he hauls himself through the arrivals hall on his backside, other passengers seem oblivious.\n\nStaff had offered to push him on a rigid high-backed chair but he refused as he felt it removed his independence.\n\nHe is now suing Luton Airport - which says it is satisfied with its response.\n\nAt the age of 20, Justin, from north London, coughed and herniated a disc. An operation to fix the problem went wrong leaving him paralysed below the waist and reliant on his self-propelling wheelchair.\n\nHis disability has not held him back. Far from it.\n\nJustin Levene says he had no option but to drag himself through the airport rather than use a chair that needed to be pushed\n\nAlmost 10 years on, Justin is an international wheelchair athlete, trainer and mentor to disabled athletes.\n\nHe recently worked with orphans and disabled children in Moldova, helping to stage the country's first inclusive marathon.\n\nHowever, in August 2017 he arrived on a flight to Luton Airport to discover his custom-made, self-propelling wheelchair had been left behind.\n\nAt the airport, staff offered to push him through the terminal on a high-backed wheelchair - an option he rejected as degrading.\n\nHe asked if he could instead be transported in a motorised buggy. However, Luton does not have one.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: \"I've worked very hard for a number of years to try and maintain all of my independence.\"\n\nWithout his wheelchair he says his self-sufficiency and independence \"was no longer there\".\n\n\"And to be in one of the chairs they were offering would make me feel humiliated and degraded.\n\n\"They insisted in trying to strap me down in it.\n\n\"I wouldn't have been able to adjust myself, and would have been at risk of getting a pressure sore.\"\n\nJustin used a luggage trolley to propel himself the final distance to a taxi\n\nJustin says the airport's failure to provide him with either a self-propelling wheelchair or a motorised buggy left him with only one viable option - to drag himself along the floor for hundreds of", "brain to swell and affecting its ability to function.\n\nDoctors often try to prevent this by lying the patient on a cool electric blanket.\n\n\"It is effective,\" said Andrea Lavinio, a neurocritical care consultant at Addenbrooke's. \"But it chills the whole body which can lead to chest infections.\"\n\nNeuronGuard has developed an alternative which is in early trials - a neck collar which only cools the blood as it enters the brain.\n\nUnlike the existing treatment, it is portable enough to be used at the scene of an accident.\n\nScientist James Piercy is using his experience as a brain injury patient to help the new HealthTech centre\n\nAs a major regional trauma centre, patients from across the eastern region will be helped, but it is hoped that the technologies found by the new centre will eventually be of national benefit.\n\nScientist James Piercy from Norwich wants spinal and brain injury patients, like him, to share their experiences with researchers.\n\nIn 2011 he suffered severe brain trauma when a tyre burst and his car skidded into a tree.\n\nJames Piercy was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital with severe brain injuries after this crash in 2011\n\n\"Walking was tricky at first because I couldn't sense where my feet were,\" he said.\n\n\"I still wear an eye patch because the damage to my skull crushed a nerve which left me with double vision.\"\n\nHe told the BBC he was pleased to be involved with the project and added: \"We don't know what the answers are yet but we know that working together we get better results.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

The BBC cannot independently verify the claims made by either country.\n\nRussia has stepped up its air campaign in recent weeks - bombarding the Ukrainian capital eight times so far this month - ahead of an expected Ukrainian offensive.\n\nOn Tuesday evening Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow had not fired as many of the Kinzhal missiles as Kyiv had claimed to have shot down.\n\nHowever if Ukraine's claims are true, Moscow will be feeling frustrated that the finest weapons from its missile fleet are now able to be intercepted. This is in large part due to the arrival of modern Western defence systems, including Patriots.\n\nRussia continues to insist that the missiles, which it says can travel at more than 11,000kmh (7,000mph), cannot be destroyed by any of the world's air defence systems.\n\nThe Kinzhal, or \"dagger\", is an air-launched ballistic missile. Most ballistic missiles reach hypersonic speed - five times the speed of sound, or just over 6,000 kmh - at some point during their flight.\n\nKyiv said it shot down a Kinzhal for the first time last week.\n\nIn the past few days, President Volodymyr Zelensky has been on a European tour in which he has been promised several billion dollars' worth of military equipment by Western allies, including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nUkraine's capital, Kyiv, has been targeted by Russia eight times so far this month\n\nDuring Tuesday's barrage footage showed air defences destroying targets over the city.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhny, said Russia attacked Kyiv from the north, south and east and that 18 air, sea and land-based missiles had been used.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of the Ukrainian capital's military administration, described the barrage as being the \"maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time\".\n\nGen Zaluzhny said that also included nine Kalibr cruise missiles, which were launched from ships in the Black Sea, and three land-based missiles.\n\nResidents on Tuesday were warned to keep away from windows as debris from intercepted missiles fell from the sky.\n\nMayor Vitali Klitschko said rocket debris had fallen in central districts, including on the city's zoo. No animals or workers were injured.\n\nKyiv resident Kseniia told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she and her husband were asleep when they heard a \"series of very loud explosions\" above their building. She compared the intensity of the attack to a Star Wars film or an action video game.\n\nShe also said that thanks to the support of its international allies, Ukraine is now capable of tracking down and destroying high calibre missiles.\n\n\"It's such a relief to know Kyiv is under such a strong defence right now\".\n\nAnother resident, Yevhen Petrov, said Tuesday's attack was the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 that his house had shaken from the force of an assault.\n\nRussia's resumption of strikes on Kyiv earlier this month came after a lull of over 50 days. The Ukrainian authorities believe Moscow's strategy is to exhaust the air defence systems, which have been extremely successful in intercepting most of the missiles and drones fired.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or injured, cities and towns have been destroyed in fighting, and 8.2 million Ukrainians have been registered as refugees in Europe with 2.8 million of them in Russia, according to data provided to the UN's refugee agency.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Lawyers are responsible. It's time to take a stand.\"\n\nIn a statement, Mr Vineall said: \"The cab rank rule prevents barristers from refusing work because they disagree with the actions or views of those seeking their services.\"\n\nThe rule \"promotes access to justice and promotes the rule of law\", he said, adding: \"It is disappointing that some lawyers apparently wish to remove these rights from people of whom they disapprove.\"\n\n\"I would be profoundly unhappy if a climate change activist accused of a public order offence were ever to be precluded from obtaining the services of the barrister of their choice because their chosen barrister happened to disapprove of the particular way in which they had been protesting,\" he said.\n\nPlan B said the declaration would be launched on 29 March outside the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nMP and former solicitor general Robert Buckland said it was a \"very odd approach\" and \"not really consistent with the role of a lawyer.\"\n\n\"When lawyers start picking and choosing, in a way it undermines the independence of the legal profession\", he told the Daily Mail.\n\nHe added: \"There are plenty of people lawyers represent who are deeply unpleasant and deeply unpopular, such as rapists and paedophiles.\n\n\"But they are entitled to a fair trial.\"Former Conservative minister Nadine Dorries has announced she is standing down as an MP.\n\nThe former culture secretary and close ally of Boris Johnson said she was standing down \"with immediate effect\" after \"something significant\" happened to change her mind.\n\nIt means there will be a by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, where she has a majority of 24,664.\n\nMs Dorries had already said she would not stand at the next general election.\n\nIt came ahead of the publication of Mr Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nMs Dorries had been expected to be nominated for an honour, but she was not included on the list.\n\nEarlier on Friday, she told TalkTV: \"The last thing I would want to do is cause a by-election in my constituency.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I will be going into the House of Lords any time soon,\" she said, adding that she had not been contacted by anybody in No 10 about the honours list.\n\nHowever, after announcing she was standing down, she told the channel: \"The House of Lords thing was on the cards and it's gone back to HOLAC [the House of Lords Appointments Commission] to be vetted.\"\n\nThe advisory body is responsible for vetting nominations for peerages.\n\nAsked if she thought she should be in the House of Lords, Ms Dorries said it was \"very rare\" for someone from her background who was born into poverty to get a peerage.\n\nShe added that she was \"slightly disappointed\" but \"I don't think it was to be\".\n\nMs Dorries said \"something significant did happen to change my mind\" about remaining an MP, but she would not give further details.\n\nShe said she now had \"other priorities\", including her granddaughter and media career as a presenter on TalkTV and columnist for the Daily Mail.\n\nThe former culture secretary said she felt \"relief\", adding: \"I think I've been carrying a degree of guilt since I stood down as secretary of state. I think I possibly, maybe I should have stood down [as an MP] then.\"\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary said Mr Johnson's peerage list had been handed to HOLAC unaltered \"as is convention\", and HOLAC then passed back its approved list.\n\n\"He [Rishi Sunak] had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" she added.\n\nBorn in Liverpool in 1957, Ms Dorries worked as a nurse before becoming an MP in 2005.\n\nShe is also a successful author of romantic historical novels and hit the headlines in 2", "30 eye conditions in a variety of settings such as a school classroom, a busy street, bus or play park.\n\nThe team involved include experts from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and Ulster University.\n\n\"We've developed software that can be manipulated to create lots of different eye conditions,\" says Ms McCracken.\n\nSara McCracken (right) says the software was inspired by with her daughter Connie (left) and her twin brother\n\n\"It's a very effective way of giving people who don't have clinical information or knowledge a really immersive impression of visual impairment.\n\n\"It's very effective for parents to be able to understand and change the way they advocate for their child but also for schools to understand the impact it has on children in the classroom or playground and, beyond that, for adults who have a visual impairment too.\"\n\nFor Caroline, the Empatheyes software has made her more understanding of Aibhilin's behaviour.\n\nShe says children with visual impairments often get very tired by the end of the week, their vision has deteriorated, and the way they are parented or taught needs to be adapted.\n\n\"I think sometimes the children with visual impairment, you're seeing the tip of the iceberg and not understanding what's underneath and driving that behaviour,\" she explains.\n\n\"Thursdays and Fridays are Aibhilin's most challenging days at school.\n\nSara McCracken has worked with Stephen Ellis from the Innovation Factory in west Belfast to develop Empatheyes\n\n\"But now, understanding her nystagmus and the way that she sees the world, and she's tired because she's held it together all week.\n\n\"I think without doing the VR technology we wouldn't understand the difference between the Aibhilin we have on a Monday and the Aibhilin we have on a Friday.\"\n\nEmpatheyes works as a social enterprise.

A key milestone was confirmation that the satellite's enormous solar array system had also deployed correctly - all 90 sq m (98 sq yds) of it.\n\n\"We have a mission; we're flying to Jupiter; we go fully loaded with questions. Juice is coming, Jupiter! Get ready for it,\" announced Andrea Accomazzo, the operations director at Esa's mission control in Darmstad, Germany.\n\nThe agency's director general, Dr Josef Aschbacher, also expressed his pride that the \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.4bn; $1.7bn) mission was safely on its way.\n\n\"But I do have to remind everyone, there's still a long way to go,\" he said. \"We have to test all the instruments to make sure they function as expected, and then, of course, arrive at Jupiter. But we have taken a very big step towards our goal.\"\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is being sent to the largest planet in the Solar System to study its major moons - Callisto, Ganymede and Europa.\n\nThese worlds are thought to retain vast reservoirs of liquid water.\n\nScientists are intrigued to know whether the moons might also host life.\n\nThis might sound fanciful. Jupiter is in the cold, outer reaches of the Solar System, far from the Sun and receiving just one twenty-fifth of the light falling on Earth.\n\nBut the gravitational squeezing the gas giant exerts on its moons means they potentially have the energy and warmth to drive simple ecosystems - much like the ones that exist around volcanic vents on Earth's ocean floors.\n\n\"In the case of Europa, it's thought there's a deep ocean, maybe 100km (62 miles) deep, underneath its ice crust,\" said mission scientist Prof Emma Bunce from Leicester University, UK.\n\n\"That depth of ocean is 10 times that of the deepest ocean on Earth, and the ocean is in contact, we think, with a rocky floor. So that provides a scenario where there is mixing and some interesting chemistry,\" the researcher told BBC News.\n\nAriane doesn't have the heft to send Juice direct to its destination, at least not in a useful timeframe.\n\nInstead, the rocket has despatched the spacecraft on to a path around the inner Solar System. A series of fly-bys of Venus and Earth will then gravitationally sling the mission out to its intended destination.\n\nIt's a 6.6 billion km journey lasting 8.5 years. Arrival in the Jovian system is expected in July 2031.\n\nThe ice-covered Callisto, Ganymede and Europa were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610, using the recently invented telescope. He could see them as little dots turning about Jupiter. (He could also see a fourth body we now know as Io, a world covered in volcanoes).\n\nThe icy trio range in diameter from 3,100km to 5,300km. To put this in context, Earth's natural satellite is roughly 3,500km across.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Prof Emma Bunce: \"The first spacecraft to go into orbit around an outer Solar System moon\"\n\nJuice will study the moons remotely. That's to say, it will fly over their surfaces; it won't land. Ganymede - the largest moon in the Solar System - is the satellite's ultimate target. It will end its tour by going into orbit around this world in 2034.\n\nRadar will be used to see into the moons; lidar, a laser measurement device, will be used to create 3D maps of their surfaces; magnetometers will explore their intricate electrical and magnetic environments; and other sensors will collect data on the whirling particles that surround the moons. Cameras, of course, will send back countless pictures.\n\nVolcanic vents on Earth's ocean floor are a model for what could exist on these moons\n\nAll this will be occurring several hundred million km from Earth where the light conditions will be dim, to say the least.\n\nThe satellite will need all the power it can get from its huge solar wings. Even at their scale, they'll still only be producing just about enough \"juice\" to run the equivalent of a domestic microwave oven - approximately 850 watts.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The party is solvent.\"\n\nHowever, the Sunday Times reported that the NEC meeting had been told by party treasurer Colin Beattie that it was \"having difficulty in balancing the books due to the reduction in membership and donors\".\n\nHe also warned that a likely Westminster by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West in the coming months could \"put the party under pressure\", according to the paper.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says the party is solvent and can meet all its current liabilities\n\nThe SNP said the report was misleading and insisted the party was ready to contest any possible by-election which could be triggered if MP Margaret Ferrier is suspended from the Commons for breaching Covid rules.\n\n\"Selected quotes being pulled out of context are not an accurate representation of the case presented at today's [Saturday's] meeting of the party's National Executive Committee,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The SNP's National Treasurer confirmed the party's finances are in balance and, as Scotland's largest political party, we will fight any by-election with the intention to win - to suggest otherwise is farcical.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the party's former Westminster leader Ian Blackford also insisted there was no immediate threat to the party's finances.\n\nAsked if the party was solvent Mr Blackford told The Sunday Show on Radio Scotland: \"Absolutely, categorically, the SNP is solvent.\n\n\"The finances are in balance. We will be able to meet our obligations and liabilities going forward.\"\n\nThe Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP acknowledged there had been \"a dip\" in membership but added he was optimistic the party would be able to reverse the decline.\n\nHe added: \"When all is said and done we have still got over 70,000 members, members that are paying subscriptions, donations coming in, parliamentarians making contributions.\n\n\"As would be normal we will be looking at how we can raise additional funds as well.\n\n\"But the party will be ready to meet all its liabilities and will certainly be ready to meet the challenge, if it comes, of a by-election in Rutherglen over the coming period.\"\n\nPolice carried out a search of the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh earlier this month as part of their investigation.\n\nLast week, Mr Yousaf revealed that he had been unaware until he became leader that the SNP's auditors had resigned more than six months ago.\n\nThe firm Johnston Carmichael quit last September, and there is concern the party may be unable to conduct an audit due in July. The party has acknowledged difficulties in recruiting new auditors.\n\nOn Thursday, the new SNP leader and first minister also said he only recently learned that the SNP had bought a luxury motorhome.\n\nIt was seized by police from outside a property in Dunfermline as part of the police investigation into the party's finances.\n\nAccording to Daily Record it was bought as a campaign bus ahead of the 2021 Holyrood election in case Covid restrictions limited other forms of social mixing - but was never used.\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell was questioned by police but released without charge\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon's husband, was arrested on 5 April while their home and the SNP's Edinburgh offices were searched as part of the police investigation. He was later released without charge pending further inquiries.\n\nMr Murrell resigned from his SNP position last month after misleading statements about party membership numbers were given to a journalist.\n\nThe police investigation follows complaints about how the party spent more than \u00a3600,000 of donations that it received from activists to fund a future independence referendum campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nOn Saturday the party's NEC approved proposals for an internal review of governance and transparency, as well as the appointment of a new chief executive through an \"open and transparent\" external recruitment process.\n\nPrior to the NEC meeting, one committee member had suggested he might resign unless \"forensic auditors\" were appointed to examine the party's finances.\n\nBill Ramsay, the SNP trade union group convener, said: \"I have been raising issues about the governance of the party for some time.\"\n\nA forensic audit is a term often used to described an audit aimed at uncovering evidence that could be presented in a court of law.\n\nMP Margaret Ferrier spoke in the House of Commons while awaiting the results of a Covid test\n\nHumza Yousaf later said a resolution passed unanimously at the NEC meeting referred to \"external input\" into the review - which could include forensic auditors.\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy questioned why the party had not yet appointed new auditors.\n\nHe said: \"People inside and outside the SNP are sick and tired of senior figures' secrecy and lack of transparency.\"\n\nAnd Scottish Labour's Jackie Baille said: \"The SNP is a party in complete disarray - with claim and counter-claim being traded in the crossfire.\"\n\nMr Yousaf was campaigning in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency on Saturday, where there is the prospect of a Westminster by-election.\n\nMargaret Ferrier won the seat for the SNP in 2019 - but was later found to have damaged the reputation of the Commons and placed people at risk by taking part in a debate and travelling by train after testing positive for Covid-19. She now sits as an independent.\n\nIf she is barred from the Commons for 10 days or more, that could trigger a recall petition, which would result in a by-election in the constituency - although 10% of voters there would need to support this for it to go ahead.The Bank of England is on \"heightened\" alert for further turmoil in the banking sector, its governor has said.\n\nHowever, Andrew Bailey told MPs the recent problems facing lenders had not caused stress in the UK banking system.\n\nOfficials have tried to calm investors since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed, sparking concerns about the stability of other lenders.\n\nIn Europe, worries over the strength of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse led to a rushed takeover by rival UBS.\n\nNerves among investors have sparked sharp falls in banking shares around the world.\n\nMr Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the Bank of England would \"go on being vigilant\".\n\nHe said we were in a period of \"very heightened, frankly, tension and alertness\".\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the biggest US banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis, and left depositors struggling to get their money out.\n\nThe collapse was linked to recent rises in interest rates which had hit the value of SVB's assets.\n\nUS regulators had to step in to protect customers, while the lender's UK arm was rescued by HSBC.\n\nThe episode has generated heated debate in the US about whether SVB was subject to appropriate supervision and if officials responded properly to its collapse.\n\nAt a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, financial regulators called the failure \"a textbook case of mismanagement,\" casting blame on SVB leaders for failing to adjust strategies as interest rates rose last year, despite warnings from officials.\n\nBut they faced questions from senators who said the episode had also revealed failures in oversight.\n\n\"It looks like regulators knew the problem but nobody dropped the hammer,\" said Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana.\n\nUK banking", "about having \"major regrets\". He replied:\n\n\"1: I deeply regret the unfortunate accident that happened. 2 regret coming here [to Yemen] should have stayed and paid the piper.\"\n\nAt the same time, I was also interviewing other people connected with the case, including Martine's father and closest friends. This made the investigation one of the most difficult I've ever worked on. While I was speaking to those whose lives had been devastated by Martine's death and were desperate for answers, my phone was continually pinging with messages from Farouk.\n\nMartine's friends Nina Brantzeg and Cecilie Dahl were with her in Maddox nightclub the night she died. Cecilie had met Farouk with Martine before, and says they were friends. But that evening, he seemed different, she says - becoming upset when one of them took a photo of him and Martine, though Martine seemed unaware of anything unusual.\n\nAnother of Martine's friends, Thale Lassen, says she thinks Farouk had once tried to kiss Martine, and she had told him she wasn't interested. In fact, she says, Martine would often crash at his flat as it was so central. CCTV shows her linking arms with Farouk as they leave the club.\n\nWhen Martine didn't come home the next day, her friends reported her missing, but say it wasn't until someone noticed Farouk had deleted his Facebook account that police took matters seriously. They searched Farouk's apartment and quickly found her semi-naked body in the basement of his block.\n\nBy this time he had fled the UK. The police knew that Farouk had taken a commercial flight from London to Cairo, but didn't have detailed knowledge of his escape.\n\nMartine (right) and Farouk on the night she died\n\nI have managed to track down one of Farouk's father's closest friends in London - a man I am calling Samir. He told me he had received a call from Farouk in the early hours of 14 March asking for cash, saying he was urgently needed at home in Cairo and his credit cards weren't working. Samir says that while he was out getting the cash, Farouk passed out on his sofa, and it took pouring ice cold water on his face to revive him.\n\n\"It was as if he was on something,\" Samir tells me.\n\nHe says Farouk bought a ticket for the next flight to Cairo, and we know that from there his father transported him to Yemen - somewhere Farouk had never lived before, but from where it would be impossible to extradite him.\n\nI spoke about this further with another friend of Farouk's father - Jordanian businessman Abdulhay Al Mejali.\n\n\"His son wanted to go to England and sit in court and defend himself,\" he told me. \"But his father advised him not to get involved [and] stay in Yemen.\"\n\nJessica Wadsworth, the Met police's lead investigator on the case at the time, admits her heart sank when they established where Farouk had gone.\n\n\"Because you've missed the chance, of course. I've never had a murder investigation\u2026 where\u2026 by three or four days in, you realise your suspect is\u2026 unattainable,\" she says.\n\nThe police met Martine's family as their flight landed from Norway to tell them the news.\n\nHer father, Odd Petter Magnussen, told me of the devastation he felt.\n\n\"As a parent, that is the hardest moment of my life. Very close, nearly physically, to be ripped apart.\"\n\nDesperate for justice, Odd Petter wrote to Queen Elizabeth in 2010, who referred the killing to then London mayor Boris Johnson. Mr Petter has received several UK government commitments to help resolve the case. I have kept in touch with him regularly over the past 12 years, and have always promised to try to get answers about what happened to his daughter.\n\nAnd now I finally had the opportunity to hear Farouk's account of that night. About a month into our correspondence, I really started to try to directly dig for the truth.\n\nN: \"Do you want to tell me what happened?\"\n\nF: \"I don't know what happened it's all a blur.\"\n\nF: \"I have flashbacks every once in a while.\"\n\nI finally spoke to him on the phone. I asked him whether he would come back to the UK to face the consequences of Martine's death.\n\n\"I don't think justice will be served,\" he told me. \"I find that the criminal justice system there [in the UK] is heavily biased. I find that they will want to make an example of me being a son of an Arab, being\u2026 a son of someone rich\u2026 it's way too late,\" he said.\n\nBBC News Arabic's Nawal Al-Maghafi seeks answers to what happened to Martine and uncovers how money, political power and Yemeni law protected Farouk once he had absconded to Yemen, which has no extradition treaty with the UK.\n\nI flew to Yemen to try to meet him in person, but when I got there he told me that he would only meet me in his house - a risk I was not prepared to take.\n\nI told him how Martine's father is desperate to know what happened.\n\n\"As a man, as a human, as someone who's moral, I think someone should do that,\" he said in a phone call. But he then continued: \"Some things are better left unsaid. The real fact is if I don't remember what happened, there's nothing really to say.\"\n\nBack in London, I tried again to get to the truth, texting that I would always want to know what happened.\n\nAnd then he replied: \"It was just an accident. Nothing nefarious.\n\nHe continued: \"No-one knows because I could barely piece together what happened.\"\n\nWhen I asked him why, he replied with just one word: \"Cocaine.\"\n\nI asked him if he'd ever spoken to a lawyer here. He said he had.\n\n[Because of] \"Leaving the country and the body was moved.\"\n\nI asked him why he moved the body.\n\nI asked him if he had thought about handing himself in, and he said lawyers had advised him not to as he would now \"serve the harshest sentence\".\n\nI asked him multiple times throughout our conversations to do an on the record interview, but he refused.\n\nIt was time to tell Martine's father about my correspondence with Farouk.\n\nOdd Petter found listening to the phone calls very difficult. This was the first time he had ever heard the voice of the man suspected of killing his daughter.\n\n\"He has no empathy, obviously, with our family, and he doesn't show any sort of remorse or anything,\" he said.\n\nBut he said the new channel of communication with Farouk made him hopeful there could now be progress.\n\n\"I'm optimistic we might have a solution in the longer term\u2026 because we can talk to him. I'm more than ever convinced that there will be a solution to this case. I just hope it will be on\u2026 my ethical terms.\"\n\nI asked him what he would want to say to Farouk.\n\n\"Go back to the UK. Tell what happened to Martine. Because not only Martine deserves that, but also our family.\n\n\"The only right thing to do here would be, of course, to give us some sort of closure to the case, but also yourself.\"\n\nMetropolitan Police responded that Farouk Abdulhak was \"quickly identified as the only suspect in her rape and murder\".\n\n\"We continue to do everything in our power to have him returned to the UK to stand trial.\"\n\nThe documentary of the investigation by BBC News Arabic and BBC Current Affairs, Murder in Mayfair will be broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday 28 March, 21:00 BST, and is also available on iPlayer.

How can they change that? Well, keeping a clean sheet feels vital to me given their situation, and they haven't managed one of those since their last league win, over Brighton on 30 January.\n\nThey have proved they have got a goal or two in them, now they need to improve at the back - but I don't think they will keep a clean sheet against Bournemouth.\n\nThe Cherries seem to have got the balance right between defence and attack and the run they are on has taken them towards the top half of the table.\n\nNathan's prediction: I don't actually think Luton are as bad as their results have been recently.

How about playing like that in a few other games?\n\nI was at Stamford Bridge for Manchester United's last-gasp defeat by Chelsea on Thursday and heard their manager Erik ten Hag talk afterwards about how his side are making progress.\n\nI just don't see it that way. Alejandro Garnacho really impressed me at Stamford Bridge but I worry about United defensively. With what is at stake for Liverpool now, I don't see United keeping them out.\n\nIt won't be a runaway victory but my feeling is it is going to be third time lucky for Jurgen Klopp's side against United this season, after a draw and a defeat in their first two meetings.\n\nLuke's prediction: This could be anything.

I really hope we get something, but I'm not too confident. 1-1\n\nNathan's prediction: I think we are going to get smashed. I hope I'm wrong but I think it could turn out to be an embarrassment. As much as I'd love to beat them, I think they are going to be fired up after the way we beat them in the FA Cup, which was one of the best games I've seen in a long time. Because of that and the injuries we've got, I am really worried. I was at Old Trafford in 2021 when they beat us 5-0 after being 4-0 up at half-time and I have got an awful feeling the same will happen again. 1-5\n\nNathan's title prediction: Oh no!

A lot of our performances have been absolutely dreadful. I know we've had injuries, but so has everyone else.\n\nLuke: That's true. Even in the Champions League, there were some silly results that meant we ended up bottom of one of the easier groups.

For the score to be 2-2 at half-time, he must have been tearing his hair out.\n\nChelsea have got a real naivety about them defensively but they still found a way to win, and they have still got a sniff of finishing high enough to qualify for Europe - which would be really remarkable given the season they have had.\n\nI still think it is last week's 2-2 draw with Burnley that sums their campaign up though, which means there is a chance they could follow Thursday by stuffing things up here.\n\nThe way I'd describe Chelsea right now is as a team that is still learning. Pochettino has made some pretty pointed comments about how his players need to work as hard out of possession as they do when they have the ball, and that applies whoever the opposition are.\n\nThey should really beat bottom side Sheffield United but they need to keep their focus and maintain their intensity.\n\nI don't feel it's the case that the Blades are running out of time to save themselves from relegation, because I think that's inevitable.

from fellow cadets, to the failures of welfare support.\n\n\"Learning that it could have been avoided with the right help, the fact that she may well have been with us now - I don't know that she was safeguarded adequately and that is so hard to comprehend.\"\n\nMs Perks was selected for officer training in 2018. She was the youngest of 180 cadets and was held in high regard.\n\nShe was in the last term of a 44-week course.\n\nLouise Townsend, Ms Perks' mother, pictured on the left, released a statement through her family's solicitor Ahmed Al-Nahhas\n\nHer mother explained they had reservations about Ms Perks joining as they were not a military family.\n\nShe said: \"She wanted to do this from the age of 14, worked tirelessly towards it - it was her dream. We were absolutely incredibly proud of how hard she'd worked.\n\n\"I remember thinking: 'Well, for 44 weeks you will be saying you'll be tired, you're exhausted, you'll be put through the motions, you may feel you don't want to pursue this - but you will be safe'.\n\n\"So it's been it's been horrific. A dreadful journey that we've been on for the past years, discovering that things weren't as they should have been.\"\n\nThe inquest heard Sandhurst academy had been rated as outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted.\n\nHowever, the coroner was also told it had only one welfare officer for 2,500 people.\n\nLt Col Rupert Whitelegge, who was commander of the academy's Old College at the time, told the inquest this level of support was \"irresponsible\".\n\nColonel Robert Manuel, president of the internal inquiry into Ms Perks' death, told the court he had found a complete breakdown in welfare support at Sandhurst.\n\nMajor General Zac Stenning said he was \"truly sorry for the systemic and individual failings\" at the academy\n\nIn a statement after the inquest, Army spokesman Maj Gen Zac Stenning, said: \"We are deeply sorry for the systemic and individual failings within the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst which led to the tragic death of Olivia Perks.\n\n\"Much more should and could have been done to support her. As an organisation we should have been better.\"\n\nMaj Gen Stenning added the inquest had been \"extremely difficult for all\" and described Ms Perks as \"a young woman full of sparkling promise\".\n\nHe continued: \"We are committed to being better and will consider all of the coroner's findings to ensure we learn any further lessons to provide the best possible leadership and care for our soldiers, officers and trainees.\n\n\"This includes zero tolerance of the utterly unacceptable behaviours exposed by the Service Inquiry and this inquest.\"\n\nMaj Gen Stenning confirmed officer cadets attending Sandhurst \"now experience vastly improved supervisory care on their journey to become future leaders.\n\n\"We owe this to Olivia and our people,\" he added.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

If that's our conclusion then it's extremely worrying,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nIf someone of that calibre was not available he said Europe's academic systems had a very big problem, pointing out that US and Chinese rules would have barred a European from getting the same kind of job.\n\nMs Scott Morton, a Yale University economics professor, is undoubtedly highly qualified, having worked for the US justice department's antitrust department during the Obama presidency.\n\nBut she has also worked as a consultant for big tech firms such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - exactly the kind of big tech digital giants her job would have required to challenge in her role as chief competition economist in Brussels.\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who has earned a reputation for taking on some of the biggest US tech firms, had robustly defended the appointment before MEPs in Brussels on Tuesday and described her corporate experience as an asset.\n\nBut in a statement on Wednesday she accepted Ms Scott Morton's decision not to take up the post \"with regret and full respect for her integrity\".\n\nIf anything, experience in private companies should be an asset, not an inconvenience\n\nFiona Scott Morton said her decision had been made not only because of the political storm surrounding her appointment but also the importance of the European Union's competition directorate having the full backing of the EU.\n\nThat prospect had become increasingly slim in recent days, not just because of President Macron's intervention.\n\nThere was also opposition from several of Ms Vestager's Commission colleagues.\n\nAnd the four biggest political blocs in the European Parliament all called on Ms Vestager to reverse the appointment, saying they had \"learnt with dismay\" that a non-EU candidate could hold such a prominent position \"at a time of intense scrutiny of our institutions vis-a-vis foreign interference\".\n\nHowever, Philippe Lamberts, co-president of the Greens, said that after talking to Ms Scott Morton his concerns had been addressed.\n\nSome commentators, such as European think tank Bruegel, said criticism of the appointment was unjustified as the role involved overseeing economic evidence in competition enforcement and protected the process not the competitors.\n\nFrench Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole said \"the European Commission and more broadly us Europeans\" were very lucky to have attracted someone of her calibre.\n\nMr Vestager told MEPs on Tuesday that the suggestion that someone's nationality might lead to bias was \"questionable\", and that Prof Scott Morton would need to recuse herself from only handful of cases.Teachers had been calling for a 10% pay rise this year\n\nScotland's council leaders have agreed to make a new offer to teachers in an attempt to end a dispute over pay.\n\nThe full details have been sent to teaching unions, who will discuss the offer on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe proposal involves a 7% rise backdated to last April, a further 5% this April and another 2% in January.\n\nSchools across Scotland have been closed by a series of strikes during the dispute, with further action planned in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Scottish government has said most teachers would see their salaries rise by \u00a35,200 in April if the new pay offer is accepted.\n\nThe latest strikes targeting the constituencies of some Scottish government ministers, including Nicola Sturgeon, are due to be held next week.\n\nTeachers are also due to hold a 20-day wave of rolling strikes between 13 March and 21 April.\n\nThe new offer follows intensive talks earlier in the week between the EIS union, Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\n\nThe EIS, the country's biggest teaching union, will now decide whether or not to consult its members on the offer, and whether to call off the scheduled strikes while a ballot is held.\n\nThe union's general secretary, Andrea Bradley, said she believed the recent talks had left the two sides \"within touching distance of a possible settlement\".\n\nThe EIS will hold meetings on Friday afternoon to discuss the new proposal, with Ms Bradley saying she was hopeful that \"we can move very quickly to a position where we can consult members on the offer\".\n\nThe union had been calling for a 10% pay rise this year, but has said a \"credible\" new offer could see strike action being suspended.\n\nAnother teaching union, the SSTA, has already said it will conduct a formal online ballot of its members on the improved offer.\n\nThe reaction of the EIS union to the new pay offer will be crucial as it is by far the largest union in Scottish education.\n\nIf it decides to consult its members and recommends that they accept it, the dispute would appear to be drawing towards its conclusion.\n\nBut if it rejects the offer, it would be a huge blow to hopes of a resolution.\n\nIf the EIS decides to consult its members, it would be wrong to presume how they will vote.\n\nSome may feel the offer is the best which is possible in the current financial climate.\n\nOthers would note that the new offer is still significantly lower than inflation.\n\nCouncil leaders are responsible for making pay offers to teachers as the employer.\n\nCouncillor Katie Hagmann, the resources spokeswoman for council umbrella body Cosla, said the improved offer had been made possible by funding assurances that had been given by the Scottish government.\n\nShe added: \"It is in all of our interests, not least those of children, young people and families, to conclude the teachers' pay negotiations as quickly as possible to bring back stability and certainty in our schools.\"\n\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney had earlier said he was \"very optimistic\" that the dispute would be resolved.\n\nBut he warned there will be \"programmes and projects that will not be going ahead\" because more money has been diverted into the new deal.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland earlier on Friday, Mr Swinney said all sides had come to a \"moment of compromise\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm very optimistic that we are in a position that we will be able to resolve the dispute in the course of today and to avoid any further disruption to education.\"\n\nThe EIS and the NASUWT unions recently rejected an offer worth 11.5% over two years. This included a 6% rise for 2022-23, backdated to last April, and a 5.5% increase for 2023-24.\n\nThe dispute has been running for more than a year.\n\nAlmost every state primary and secondary school in Scotland was closed on Tuesday and Wednesday as members of the EIS and NASUWT walked out in the latest national strike action.\n\nPupils in the constituencies of senior politicians have been worst affected, as targeted strike action by members of the EIS last week closed schools for three additional days.\n\nThe same areas, which include those represented by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Swinney, face another three days of strikes next week.The charges include conspiracy, false statements and illegally retaining classified documents, says Mr Trump's attorney\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has been charged over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nMr Trump, 76, faces seven counts, including mishandling classified documents and obstructing efforts to investigate the storage of the files at his Florida home", "\nBut it is not only the players who should shoulder the responsibility for this horror show.\n\nJust as he did against the United States and Iran at the World Cup, Page got this game horribly wrong.\n\nWales still have five games left to revive their hopes of qualifying for Euro 2024 but this result could have long-lasting and serious ramifications for Page and his players.\n\nWhile Wales wallow in the humiliation of this result, Armenia can bask in the afterglow of one of their greatest victories.\n\nThey had lost nine of their previous 10 competitive matches, conceding 29 goals in the process and sliding down to 97 in the world rankings.\n\nIn Cardiff, however, they made a mockery of those statistics, harrying their opponents and counter-attacking astutely.\n\nTheir goals were no flukes. Indeed, they could have scored more and, apart from the occasional wayward shot, the visitors' finishing was supreme.\n\nThis was also a moment to savour for their manager Oleksandr Petrakov, who had stood by the same touchline a year ago as his then Ukraine side were beaten by Wales in their World Cup play-off final.\n\nThe pain of that rain-soaked Sunday afternoon may now have eased for Petrakov, while the jubilation of World Cup qualification seems like a distant memory for Wales.\n\u2022 None Norberto Briasco (Armenia) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

Their focus is on helping Ukraine win the battle on the ground.\n\nThe front lines are swamped with air defence systems on both sides. The Russian air force is much bigger than Ukraine's and it hasn't been able to gain control of the skies.\n\nAt the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.\n\nOn Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted that his government had approved sending the country's 13 MiG-29s to Ukraine.\n\nHe said \"promises must be kept\" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for more weapons.\n\nIt is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are operational.\n\nMr Heger said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.\n\nOn Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.\n\nAs with its pledge of Leopard tanks, Poland has broken a barrier. This was a step no-one was prepared to take a year ago.\n\nNews of the pledges came amid Russian media reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had decorated pilots involved in an incident earlier this week .\n\nWashington has condemned the Russian actions, in which it says one of the Su-27 jets clipped the drone, as reckless, but Moscow says the drone failed on its own.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire had already introduced \u00a32 caps as part of longer-term schemes, which began in 2022.\n\nTransport Focus spoke to 1,111 people in March, all aged under 65 and living outside London.\n\nSome 11% of respondents said they were using the bus to travel more - up from 7% in January.\n\nAwareness of the scheme has also increased, the watchdog said, with three quarters of regular bus users aware of the \u00a32 fare cap. Respondents showed the highest awareness in the North East, Yorkshire and Humberside and the north West of England.\n\nAwareness of the scheme was lowest in the West Midlands, Transport Focus said.\n\nThe majority of respondents to the survey thought the cap was helpful in battling rising costs as inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hits near record levels.\n\nDavid Sidebottom, director of Transport Focus, said the bus fare was having a \"big impact\", as cheaper fares were \"vital in winning passengers back\".\n\nHe added that the cap was \"providing a lifeline for bus routes up and down the country\".\n\nOne passenger told Transport Focus: \"Before it was about \u00a34 for a single journey and \u00a37 for a return which is so expensive. \u00a32 is a great price and should be made permanent,\"\n\nThe Office for National Statistics had said the \u00a32 fare cap was a contributing factor in inflation slowing down in January.Last updated on .From the section Athletics\n\nWorld Athletics has banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events.\n\nThe governing body's president, Lord Coe, said no transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions from 31 March.\n\nA working group will be set up to conduct further research into the transgender eligibility guidelines.\n\n\"We're not saying no forever,\" he said.\n\nUnder previous rules, World Athletics required transgender women to reduce their amount of blood testosterone to a maximum of 5nmol/L, and stay under this threshold continuously for a period of 12 months before competing in the female category.\n\nLord Coe added the decision was \"guided by the overarching principle which is to protect the female category\".\n\nHe noted that there are currently no transgender athletes competing internationally in the sport.\n\n\"Decisions are always difficult when they involve conflicting needs and rights between different groups, but we continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations,\" said Lord Coe.\n\n\"We will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage which will inevitably develop over the coming years. As more evidence becomes available, we will review our position, but we believe the integrity of the female category in athletics is paramount.\"\n\nThe Council agreed to set up a working group for 12 months to \"further consider the issue of transgender inclusion\".\n\nAn independent chair will lead the group, while it will also include up to three council members, two athletes from the Athletes' Commission, a transgender athlete, three representatives of World Athletics' member federations and representatives of the World Athletics health and science department.\n\nIt will consult specifically with transgender athletes, as well as review and commission research and put forward recommendations to the Council.\n\nThe World Athletics Council also voted to reduce the amount of blood testosterone permitted for athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) such as South Africa's Caster Semenya.\n\nDSD is a group of rare conditions whereby a person's hormones, genes and/or reproductive organs may be a mix of male and female characteristics. Some of those affected prefer the term \"intersex\".\n\nDSD athletes will be required to reduce their blood testosterone level to below 2.5 nanomoles per litre, down from five, and must remain under this threshold for two years in order to compete internationally in the female category in any track and field event.\n\nUnder previous regulations, DSD athletes were only restricted in events ranging from 400m to a mile.\n\nInterim provisions will be introduced for DSD athletes already competing in previously unrestricted events, requiring them to suppress their testosterone levels below 2.5nmol/L for a minimum of six months before they are allowed to compete again.\n\nCoe said this will impact 13 DSD athletes, seven (55%) of whom compete in running events above a mile, with six (45%) in sprinting events below 400m.\n\nHe added none of the 13 will now be able to compete in the World Athletics Championships in Budapest in August, but will be eligible for future events, including the Paris 2024 Olympics, \"if they maintain their testosterone at the required level\".\n\nSemenya, who refuses to take testosterone-reducing drugs, won 800m Olympic gold in 2012 and 2016 but has not been able to compete in the event since 2019, when World Athletics introduced the previous restrictions.\n\nAs recently as January, World Athletics said its \"preferred option\" was to continue to allow transgender women to compete in the female category but to tighten the sport's eligibility rules, still using testosterone limits as the basis for inclusion.\n\nIt had proposed that transgender women would have to reduce their blood testosterone level to below 2.5nmol/L for two years, bringing it in line with amendments made last year by the UCI, cycling's world governing body.\n\nHowever, World Athletics said there was \"little support\" for this option when it was presented to stakeholders, who included member federations, athletes, coaches, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as well as representative transgender and human rights groups.\n\nMany argue that transgender women should not compete in elite women's sport because of any advantages they may retain - but others argue that sport should be more inclusive.\n\nThe debate centres on the balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety in women's sport - essentially, whether transgender women can compete in female categories without an unfair advantage.\n\nThe IOC's framework on transgender athletes - released in November 2021 - states that there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female sporting events, and places responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport.\n\nIn February, UK Athletics said it wanted a change in legislation to ensure the women's category is lawfully reserved for competitors who are recorded female at birth.\n\nThe governing body said all transgender athletes should be allowed to compete with men in an open category to \"ensure fairness\" in women's competition.\n\nWhat are the rules in other sports?\n\nIn June 2022, Lord Coe welcomed the move by Fina - swimming's world governing body - to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they had gone through any part of the process of male puberty, insisting \"fairness is non-negotiable\".\n\nFina's decision followed a report by a taskforce of leading", "moths in the carpet, the cellar was flooded, we had no bath, the toilet broke so we had no toilet,\" she said.\n\nWith mould and damp also causing problems, Chiara complained about the state of the flat to her landlord.\n\n\"They responded with a Section 21, giving us two months' notice to vacate the property,\" she said.\n\n\"We were kicked out because we complained.\"\n\nChiara, who is a teacher in Walthamstow, said that after they got the notice in January, the family experienced a frantic search to find a new home, finally moving into a new place two weeks ago.\n\nShe said while searching they discovered that rents had surged.\n\nChiara said it made it \"pretty much impossible\" for them to find another two-bed flat with a garden, so now the family has moved into a one-bed.\n\nAccording to a YouGov survey of just over 2000 private renting adults in England commissioned by charity Shelter, tenants facing issues with properties who then complained about disrepair to their landlord were more than twice as likely to be handed an eviction notice than those who had not.\n\nThe research found that 76% of private renters in England have experienced disrepair in the last year, and a quarter of renters have not asked for repairs to be carried out due to fear of eviction.\n\n\"We just need to get rid of Section 21,\" said Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive.\n\nShe added there needed to be a \"situation where landlords can evict people for legitimate reasons, and can't evict them just because they complain about the poor condition of their home\".\n\nDavid and Samira from Richmond in North Yorkshire have had a similar experience to Chiara and her family.\n\nThe couple were issued with a no-fault eviction just before Christmas after complaining about damp.\n\nSamira was six months' pregnant at the time.\n\nDavid said the eviction was \"really unfair\" and caused a lot of stress for the parents-to-be.\n\n\"Looking at the options we had as tenants there was very little we could do. It was just really baffling, really confusing, it doesn't seem like a fair process,\" David added, after being outbid or rejected for more than 30 properties they had viewed.\n\n\"Soul destroying is the term I'd use for it, it was just rejection after rejection after rejection.\"\n\nDavid and Samira managed to find a new home just in time for the arrival of their daughter Aila last week.\n\nThe government is due to introduce a Renters' Reform Bill before the summer, which it has said will redress the balance in the market and provide more security for tenants.\n\nHousing rules are different in each of the devolved nations, and Scotland and Wales have already banned no fault evictions.First LV= Insurance Ashes Test, Edgbaston (day two of five)\n\nEngland wasted chances and were defied by a classy century from Australia's Usman Khawaja on a riveting second day of the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston.\n\nKhawaja batted throughout the day for his unbeaten 126, the left-hander's first Ashes ton in England guiding Australia to 311-5, just 82 runs adrift.\n\nHe was bowled by a Stuart Broad no-ball on 112, one of four errors from England that also included Jonny Bairstow missing two opportunities behind the stumps.\n\nIn an electrifying morning session, England used favourable overhead conditions to reduce the tourists to 67-3 in reply to their 393-8 declared.\n\nThe renewal of Broad's battle with David Warner resulted in a 15th dismissal in Test cricket and, next ball, Broad sent Edgbaston into rapture by having Marnus Labuschagne brilliantly caught by Bairstow.\n\nBen Stokes, proving his fitness to bowl, trapped Steve Smith lbw for 16.\n\nBut Khawaja stood firm, adding 81 with Travis Head, who made 50, and 72 with Cameron Green. Both Head and Green were removed by Moeen Ali on his return to Test cricket.\n\nEven at 220-5, Australia were on the back foot, only for Khawaja to add another unbroken stand of 91 with Alex Carey, the beneficiary of a Bairstow drop in his 52 not out.\n\nBy the end, Australia had moved to a position from where they can take a first-innings lead, which could be crucial on an extremely dry pitch that seems set to deteriorate later in the match.\n\u2022 None 'No excuse' for crucial no-ball, says Broad\n\u2022 None 'Stokes has told Australia \"I'm not scared of you\"'\n\nIf day one was frantic from start to finish, this was a strategic battle, yet still every bit as compelling, dramatic and competitive.\n\nJust as they were defensive in the field on Friday, Australia barely engaged in England's full-throttle approach. There were more maidens in the first three overs than the whole of day one and Australia crawled at marginally more than two an over in the first session - and it played right into England's hands.\n\nStokes was relentlessly tinkering. Seven bowlers were employed in the first session, and the use of Harry Brook's medium pace inside the first hour stretched credulity. Smith was greeted by eight close catchers on his arrival.\n\nBroad's dismissal of Warner was almost comical in its inevitability, followed by wild celebrations at the Labuschagne dismissal next ball. The Edgbaston roar returned when Stokes got Smith and for Moeen's important interventions.\n\nBut on such a placid surface, and with Khawaja fronting the Australian resistance, England needed to take all of their chances. The four mistakes - there was also an edge between Bairstow and slip Joe Root in the dying moments - could yet prove to be hugely costly.\n\nKhawaja stands up in the chaos\n\nSince being recalled in the last Ashes series, Khawaja has outperformed all of his Australia team-mates, but retained the stigma of an average below 18 in this country.\n\nHowever, this was an assured century when Australia badly needed him - Khawaja showing steel to be the constant presence in the rearguard partnerships with Head, Green and Carey.\n\nKhawaja is a beautifully languid player. When England's pace bowlers dropped short, he swivelled to pull. When Moeen was bowling, he chased down the pitch to hit straight, twice for six.\n\nHe reached his 15th Test hundred, and first Ashes century outside of Sydney, by late-cutting Stokes then celebrated passionately by throwing his bat into the air. At the end of the day, he took his daughter to the news conference.\n\nKhawaja was, though, decisively beaten in Broad's first over with the second new ball. With the off stump pegged back, Khawaja's walk back to the pavilion was halted when the TV umpire detected the no-ball.\n\nBy that point, Carey had been let off on 26 by Bairstow off Root's off-spin and later, on 46, another edge off Moeen went between the keeper and Root, who was slow to move low to his right.\n\nEngland were superb in the morning session, making use of clouds and humidity that even the home side could not have predicted when they surprisingly declared on Friday.\n\nAfter Australia resumed on 14-0, Warner had added only one to his overnight eight when he played a wild hack at Broad and dragged on. Next ball, world number one-rated batter Labuschagne poked at an out-swinger and was superbly caught one-handed by Bairstow.\n\nSmith, so often England's tormentor, was easing himself in when he got into an awful position to Stokes. Even after seeing the review, Smith could not believe the decision.\n\nFrom then on, England had to work much harder. Khawaja and Head frequently belted Moeen down the ground, only for Stokes to refuse to drop men out.\n\nIt worked when Head miscued to mid-wicket and Moeen followed with a beauty that turned to bowl Green through the gate. In his first Test in almost two years, Moeen performed admirably, getting through 29 overs.\n\nGreen should have been stumped off his second ball by Bairstow, who also missed the fine edge off Carey.", "mother Sinead James, 30.\n\nMs James denies causing or allowing her daughter's death at the family home in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.\n\nDr Stalker, a paediatrician, said she didn't think there was a part of Lola, who had 101 external injuries, that was not bruised.\n\nMr Bevan, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, claimed the family's American bulldog, Jessie, caused Lola's injuries by pushing her down the stairs.\n\nDr Stalker said: \"In my opinion Lola's severe and extensive injuries cannot be explained by a fall down the stairs.\n\n\"Physical abuse is the most likely cause. A stair fall does not explain the catastrophic and extensive injuries to the head with bleeding to both eyes.\"\n\nShe told the court such injuries were associated with physical abuse.\n\nLola's mother Sinead James is charged with causing or allowing her daughter's death\n\nDr Stalker said: \"An extensive subdural haemorrhage is usually the result of a high velocity road traffic collision where a child is thrown from the collision, or a fall from a great height, such as a fall from a balcony or bedroom window of more than 10 feet.\"\n\nBruising such as Lola had to her ears was rarely the result of an accident, the court heard.\n\n\"It is usually the result of a direct blow, not one from a fall,\" Dr Stalker said.\n\nShe added that injuries like those on Lola's neck were rarely caused accidentally but could have resulted from strangulation.\n\nDr Stalker said it was unlikely Lola's bruises could have been caused accidentally and that their large size was unusual.\n\nA lot of them were of a kind normally caused by gripping and often associated with abuse.\n\n\"Injuries to the neck are also very unlikely to be caused by accident and can be caused by strangulation,\" she said.\n\n\"The whole picture of Lola's head injuries led me to conclude they were caused by abusive head trauma.\"\n\nThe court heard shaking was the most likely cause of Lola's brain injuries.\n\nDr Stalker said injuries to Lola's back and legs were extensive and caused by a forceful blow.\n\n\"It looks like three or four blows with a weapon,\" she said.\n\nDr Stalker said she could find no medical reason to explain Lola's injuries.Three judges at the Court of Appeal reduced Foster's prison sentence on Tuesday\n\nA mother who was jailed for illegally taking abortion tablets to end her pregnancy during lockdown will be released from prison after the Court of Appeal reduced her sentence.\n\nCarla Foster, 45, admitted illegally procuring her own abortion when she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant.\n\nA judge told her last month she would serve half her 28-month term in custody and the remainder on licence.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal reduced the term to 14 months suspended.\n\nDame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Lambert at the London court on Tuesday, called it \"a very sad case\".\n\n\"It is a case that calls for compassion, not punishment,\" Dame Victoria said.\n\nFoster appeared at the hearing via a video link from Foston Hall prison, Derbyshire.\n\nThe mother-of-three from Staffordshire was jailed at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on 12 June.\n\nThe court heard she had moved back in with her ex-partner at the start of lockdown, while carrying another man's baby.\n\nThe government has approved the use of pills by post for abortion treatment\n\nShe procured pills by post from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) after providing information that led staff to believe she was seven weeks pregnant.\n\nAlthough abortion is legal up to 24 weeks, after 10 weeks the procedure is carried out in a clinic.\n\nOn 11 May 2020, after she took the abortion pills, emergency services received a call to say she had gone into labour.\n\nThe baby was born not breathing during the call and pronounced dead about 45 minutes later.\n\nFoster was initially charged with child destruction, which she denied.\n\nShe later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.\n\nDame Victoria told the court there was \"no useful purpose\" served by detaining Foster in custody, and added her case had \"exceptionally strong mitigation\".\n\nFoster's barrister Barry White said there had been a lack of \"vital reports\" into his client's mental health and the pandemic had added to her existing anxiety.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also heard the prison had not allowed Foster any communication with her children during her 35-day incarceration, one of whom is autistic.\n\nMr White highlighted Foster had voluntarily revealed her actions to police, adding: \"Had she not done that, it is highly unlikely that she would have ever been prosecuted.\"\n\nRobert Price, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the original sentence was not \"manifestly excessive\" and the judge had \"correctly made allowances for mitigating factors in this unusually sensitive case\".\n\nAs well as the 14-month suspended prison sentence, Foster will also have to complete up to 50 days of activity.\n\nIn response to the verdict, chief executive of the BPAS Clare Murphy said she was \"delighted\" the mother would be released from prison and called for a change to the law.\n\n\"The court of appeal has today recognised that this cruel, antiquated law does not reflect the values of society today,\" she said.\n\n\"Now is the time to reform abortion law so that no more women are unjustly criminalised for taking desperate actions at a desperate time in their lives.\"\n\nRight to Life UK, however, urged the government to reject legislation changes and called for a \"full inquiry\" into how BPAS had come to dispatch Foster's abortion pills.\n\n\"Campaigners, led by BPAS... are using this tragic case to call for the removal of more abortion safeguards and the introduction of abortion up to birth across the United Kingdom,\" said spokesperson Catherine Robinson.\n\n\"At at least 32 weeks or around eight months' gestation, [the baby] was a fully formed human child.

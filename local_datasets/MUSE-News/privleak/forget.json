["international travellers had to isolate on their return to the UK.\n\n\"I just want to see some of the faces of people coming out of first class and into a Premier Inn shoe box,\" he told Mr Hancock.\n\nA collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph. Here are some of our stories on the leaks:\n\nA former senior civil servant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the exchanges published by the Telegraph did not necessarily tell the whole story.\n\nBut discussing government business on WhatsApp in this way suggested \"a lack of professionalism\", not least because the messages can be made public.\n\n\"It does seem to display a laxity in the decision-making process. with decisions being made for, frankly, emotional, personal, or 'small p' political reasons\", he said of Mr Case's exchanges with Mr Hancock.\n\nSome of this may be down to Mr Case's \"inexperience\" as a senior civil servant, he suggested, and his apparent desire to act as \"courtier\" to ministers, rather than an impartial adviser.\n\n\"As a cabinet secretary, you don't need to curry favour, to be seen to be 'on side' with ministers, in this case Matt Hancock,\" said the former civil servant.\n\nIt was, he suggested, \"illustrative, perhaps, of a lack of grip on the job\" and he would not be surprised if Mr Case was considering quitting.\n\n\"There is wisdom in choosing the time of your own departure and maybe that is something he will be thinking about.\"\n\nThe messages are part of trove of more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages leaked to the Telegraph by journalist Isabel Oakeshott.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify the messages, which were supplied to Ms Oakeshott in confidence by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\nMr Hancock has said they offer an \"entirely partial account\" of the government's handling of the pandemic.Last updated on .From the section Snooker\n\nCoverage: Watch live on BBC TV and Red Button with uninterrupted coverage on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and the BBC Sport app\n\nMark Selby created history as he became the first player to make a maximum 147 break in a World Championship final.\n\nBut the four-time world champion trails Luca Brecel 9-8 going into Monday's last day of action.\n\n\"The atmosphere when I potted that final black was electric. It is incredible. Just to make a 147 here is hard enough,\" said 39-year-old Selby.\n\n\"I always thought that if I got in that position I would be shaking like a leaf. It was amazing how calm I felt.\"\n\nBelgium's Brecel had dominated the opening session with his flamboyant attacking style to open up a 6-2 advantage.\n\nHowever, Selby, who appeared jaded on Sunday afternoon as a consequence of the draining late-night finish to his semi-final victory over Mark Allen, delivered a superb riposte in an exhilarating second session.\n\nA high-quality start saw Selby finally display his devastating potting ability, opening with a 134 break and then a 96 as he reeled off three of the first four frames.\n\nBrecel, who crafted a brilliant 99 of his own in the 10th frame of the match, constructed back-to-back half centuries to re-establish a four-frame lead at 9-5.\n\nBut Selby again responded, pinching the final frame of the session after his 147 to leave snooker's blue-riband event delicately poised when play resumes at 13:00 BST on Monday.\n\nSelby's special effort arrived in the 16th frame of the match, with the Englishman coming to the table after Brecel had left a red hanging in the jaws of the bottom corner pocket.\n\nAs excitement built he went on to superbly pot a difficult final red with the rest to clear all 15 reds, all accompanied by blacks, before dispatching the colours.\n\nIt prompted joyous scenes as the fans inside the auditorium erupted.\n\nReferee Brendan Moore, officiating in his third and last Crucible final before retirement, congratulated Selby, who was also embraced warmly by Brecel.\n\nSelby's feat comes 40 years on from the first ever maximum at the Crucible, compiled by Cliff Thorburn in 1983.\n\nThe Englishman is the 10th player to achieve a total clearance at the Sheffield venue - Kyren Wilson also made a 147 earlier in the tournament.\n\nThere have been 14 maximums in total at the Crucible with Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry making three each.\n\nThe select band of players to reach the magical tally is completed by Cliff Thorburn, Jimmy White, Mark Williams, Ali Carter, John Higgins and Neil Robertson.\n\nWilson's 147 came during his 10-5 first-round win against Ryan Day.\n\nSelby is set to share with him an additional \u00a355,000 in prize money, with \u00a340,000 on offer for a 147 and \u00a315,000 for the tournament's highest break.\n\nIt was amazing, to be here and have a bird's eye view of it, it's a magical moment in Crucible history.\n\nTo make a maximum in a final is just the icing on the cake for Mark Selby in his career.\n\nPhenomenal. Iconic pictures. The irony that during the interval we were running a piece about Cliff Thorburn [making the Crucible's first maximum in 1983] and celebrating the anniversary of that, to then a couple of frames later [for Selby to make one].\n\nIt was absolutely amazing. What a competitor. To then follow that up by winning the final frame, that is absolutely vital. A very interesting day that we're set up for tomorrow.Primary school children in England have ranked fourth in the international rankings for reading.\n\nThe latest results in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study - known as Pirls - saw England's rank jump from eighth to enter the top five.\n\nBased on tests taken every five years, the study places countries in a global education league table.\n\nThe Pirls tests are taken by nine and 10-year-olds, normally Year 5 pupils in England, at the end of the school year.\n\nThe 2021 testing round assessed nearly 400,000 pupils in 57 countries.\n\nBut 14 of those - including Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - delayed testing to the start of the next school year because of disruption caused by the Covid pandemic, meaning the students taking part were older.\n\nThe International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which runs the study, said direct comparisons with those 14 countries should be made \"with great care\".\n\nWhen included in comparisons, Northern Ireland ranked fifth - up from joint sixth in the previous round of testing.\n\nThe IEA said England could be reliably compared with other countries even though it pushed back testing until 2022 to avoid Covid disruption, because it tested the same age group as the other countries.\n\nIn those rankings, Singapore scored the highest result, with an average score of 587.\n\nSecond was Hong Kong with an average score of 573, followed by Russia (567) and England (558).\n\nWales and Scotland do not submit results to Pirls but Scotland is set to join the next cycle.\n\nSchools minister Nick Gibb said England's success was aided by government reforms, including a focus on phonics, which teaches children to read using sounds, and to teachers \"putting reading at the heart of everything they do\".\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the \"excellent results\" were \"a badly needed piece of good news for an education system that feels beleaguered\".\n\nHe said the success was testament to the \"hard work, skill and dedication of primary school teachers and leaders\".\n\nOverall, girls were ahead of boys in their reading achievement in nearly all of the ranked countries, but the gender gap has narrowed in the most recent testing round.\n\nThe Pirls results came days after a Year 6 Sats reading paper, which some parents said was so hard it left children in tears.\n\nMr Gibb said the assess", "\"I am truly and deeply sorry - it's something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life, and I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this case.\"\n\nIn July 2021, an inquest jury concluded that the deaths were accidental and the victims were not unlawfully killed.\n\nThe case against Mr Dorris was brought by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which said it \"conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation\" into the derailment.\n\nThe ORR also prosecuted TfL and the tram operator Tram Operations Limited under health and safety laws. Both companies previously pleaded guilty to not taking reasonable care and will be sentenced next month.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police\n\nThe killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up.\n\nAn only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league.\n\nHis education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician.\n\nThose who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father.\n\nHis record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record.\n\nHe had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\".\n\nShortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence.\n\n\"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\"\n\nHis grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\".\n\n\"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen.\n\nThe programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician.\n\nOvale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\".\n\n\"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien.\n\nHe praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media.\n\nHe had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate.\n\nShortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters.\n\nHis mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\"\n\n\"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium.\n\nFlowers were left at the site where Nahel died\n\n\"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel.\n\nBut the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice.\n\n\"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtemp\u00e9rer - refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nWhen he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.\n\nHis name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations.\n\nLast September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\". Most of the trouble he got into involved cars: driving without a licence or insurance and using false number plates.\n\nBut Nahel had never been convicted, said family lawyer Jennifer Cambla, and had no criminal record. Being known to police was not the same as a criminal record, because he had never been tried for anything listed on his police file, she told French TV.\n\n\"I think in this kind of suburb it's pretty rare that a young person hasn't been stopped by police or hasn't been in custody,\" Ms Cambla said.\n\nThe riots that his death has provoked are a reminder for many in France of the events of 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00e9, were electrocuted as they fled police after a game of football and ran into an electricity substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois.\n\n\"It could have been me, it could have been my little brother,\" a Clichy teenager called Mohammed told French website Mediapart.South Wales Police is set to start reusing technology ruled unlawful in 2020\n\nCivil rights groups have claimed facial recognition technology will make racism within the police worse.\n\nSouth Wales Police is set to restart using the controversial technology after an independent review said it was not discriminatory.\n\nBut Liberty said history showed it would \"always be used disproportionately against communities of colour\".\n\nThe force insisted the technology would be used responsibly.\n\nLive facial recognition enables police to find people at big events suspected of committing crimes.\n\nIn 2020, appeal court judges ruled a trial project to scan thousands of faces by South Wales Police was unlawful.\n\nThe force had paused its use of the technology amid concerns over discrimination, but will resume in the wake of a report commissioned in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIt found there were minimal discrepancies for race and sex when the technology is used at certain settings.\n\nAn independent review said the technology was not discriminatory\n\nLiberty, which describes itself as \"the UK's largest civil liberties organisation,\" said the technology was oppressive and had no place in a democracy.\n\n\"Our ability to express ideas, communicate with others and engage in democratic processes will be undermined by technology such as facial recognition,\" said campaigns manager Emmanuelle Andrews.\n\n\"The expansion of mass surveillance tools has no place on the streets of a rights respecting democracy.\"\n\nSouth Wales Police chief constable Jeremy", "\nA spokesperson confirmed the murals were removed on Tuesday, adding: \"We do all we can to ensure children are safe, secure and supported as we urgently seek placements with a local authority.\n\n\"All children receive a welfare interview on their arrival at accommodation, which includes questions designed to identify potential indicators of trafficking or safeguarding issues.\n\n\"Our priority is to stop the boats and disrupt the people smugglers.\"\n\nLabour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock condemned Mr Jenrick's order, saying the idea that removing the murals would \"somehow stop the boats is utterly absurd\".\n\nHe said it was a sign of a \"chaotic government in crisis, whose failing approach means all they have left is tough talk and cruel and callous policies\".\n\nLabour had a plan to \"end the dangerous crossings, defeat the criminal smuggler gangs, and end hotel use by clearing the asylum backlog,\" he added.\n\nThe i newspaper, which was first to report the story, quoted sources as saying staff at the centre were \"horrified\" by Mr Jenrick's order and resisted carrying out the work.\n\nA report published last month by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons after visits to KIU, and the nearby processing centres at Manston and Western Jet Foil, found there had been improvements in facilities since previous inspections.\n\nBut continuing problems, including medical isolation practices at KIU. The report concluded: \"Inspectors found no examples of notable positive practice during this inspection\" at KIU.\n\nThe Home Office said it had taken action to address some of the recommendations.One of the UK's largest private pension funds has backed Thames Water to turnaround its finances and performance after fears the firm could collapse.\n\nUniversities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a major investor in the water firm, is the first to publicly support it as it looks to secure extra funding.\n\nThames Water is billions of pounds in debt and there have been calls for it to be nationalised.\n\nUSS said the firm \"could benefit\" from having it among its shareholders.\n\n\"We know that leakage and sewage remain major issues, but we also know there are no quick fixes where a complex network of pipes stretching for miles - some of which have been in the ground for 150 years - need to be replaced,\" said USS group chief executive Bill Galvin.\n\nMr Galvin added improvements would \"take time\" and added \"significant investment is needed\".\n\nThames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years due to sewage discharges and leaks. The company leaks more water than any other water company in UK, losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic size swimming pools every day from its pipes.\n\nIts chief executive, Sarah Bentley, resigned last week, weeks after she was asked to forgo her bonus over the company's handling of sewage spills.\n\nThames Water is a private company, owned by a group of investors, with the largest being the Canadian pension fund, OMERS, with 31.8%.\n\nOMERS has declined to comment on the water firm's current situation, but USS, a pension fund for UK academics and the second biggest investor with a 19.7% stake, is the first to announce its support.\n\n\"We have given our backing to Thames Water's turnaround plan and Net Zero roadmap and engage with them regularly to support their long-term strategy,\" Mr Galvin said in note to staff, which was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\n\"We remain of the view that, with an appropriate regulatory environment, the long-term objective of repairing important UK infrastructure and paying pensions to our members are in strong alignment.\"\n\nThames Water said last week that it was trying to raise the cash it needs to improve.\n\nIt said it was keeping water regulator Ofwat informed on progress, and that it still had \"strong\" cash and borrowing reserves to draw on.\n\nThe government has said it was ready to act in a worst case scenario if Thames Water collapsed.\n\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies will continue as normal to customers.\n\nLast year Thames Water's owners - including USS - pumped \u00a3500m into the business and pledged a further \u00a31bn to help it to improve.\n\nBut the company is understood to be struggling to raise the remaining cash which it needs to service its substantial debt pile, which is around \u00a314bn. Interest payments on more than half of its debt are linked to the rate of inflation, which has soared over the last year.\n\nOther water firms are also facing similar pressures due to higher interest payments on their debts and rising costs including higher energy and chemical prices.Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.\n\nRetired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.\n\nThe IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.\n\nThe military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.\n\nBy the end, all the aid workers were dead.\n\nThe IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening.\n\nIt also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.\n\nThree of the charity's cars were struck during the attack\n\nThe evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.\n\nIn addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.\n\nThe IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.\n\nThe aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.\n\nDuring this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.\n\nAt this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.\n\nThe drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: US says Israel must make changes in the coming \"hours and days\"\n\nThe military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility.\n\nMeanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.\n\nThe drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one", "there is no technical reason. The film has showed in over 4,000 cinema screens worldwide. These 30-plus screens in Hong Kong are the only ones with such issues.\"\n\nThe horror movie has received a score of just 4% on film rating site Rotten Tomatoes. It depicts the bear, known for being kind and honest, as a vengeful axe wielding half-man, half-bear.\n\nIt went viral online when the trailer was released.\n\nFrake-Waterfield was able to make the film when the 95-year copyright on Milne's first Winnie the Pooh story elapsed in the US in January last year.\n\nBut Disney - which bought some licences in the 1960s - still owns certain rights. Trademark laws mean the bear cannot wear a red T-shirt in the horror film, for example.\n\n\"We weren't allowed to have him say things like 'oh bother' either,\" Frake-Waterfield told BBC Culture last month.\n\n\"There are these elements where we need to be careful not to encroach on their brand and their territory because that's not the intention.\n\n\"The intention isn't just to steal their copyright and use it for our own purposes. It's to go from something which is possible to use because it's now publicly available, and just go off on an extreme tangent from that point and make this horrific alternative version to him.\"Labour has ruled out introducing a self-ID system to allow people to change their legal sex without a medical diagnosis.\n\nLeader Sir Keir Starmer has previously said his party would introduce such a system if it wins power.\n\nBut shadow women and equalities secretary Anneliese Dodds has now said medical diagnosis upholds \"confidence in the system\".\n\nShe added that the requirement also helps people access NHS support.\n\nIn a article for the Guardian, she wrote that Labour would streamline the current medical diagnosis rules, calling them \"demeaning\".\n\nThe new Labour position appears to be a compromise that has emerged from a party event in Nottingham over the weekend to discuss policy.\n\nIt opens up a split with Scottish Labour, which has previously voted to remove the medical diagnosis requirement and has since confirmed it \"continues to support the de-medicalisation of the process in Scotland\".\n\nUnder current rules, people who want to change legal sex need to provide a medical report showing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\n\nThis is defined by the NHS as a \"sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\n\nApplicants also have to provide evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least two years.\n\nSome campaigners say the the requirement is excessively bureaucratic and invasive, and have long argued for a non-medical process - known as self-identification - instead.\n\nThe government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.\n\nLabour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\n\nSir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to \"introduce self-declaration\" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an \"important part\" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.\n\n\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.\n\nShe added that Labour wanted to avoid the \"mistakes\" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.\n\nScottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a \"cavalier approach\", she added.\n\nHowever, she added the current requirement to apply to an \"anonymous\" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it \"demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice\".\n\nInstead, she said it \"should be enough\" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.\n\nThe LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a \"huge step forward\" for trans people over the current government stance.\n\nBut it added the party was \"signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election\".\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to \"externally verify\" someone's acquired gender.\n\nRosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the \"core thing\" demanded by women's groups.\n\nMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges and prisons.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she called for more clarity on the party's position ahead of the general election, expected next year, adding it still included a \"bit of confusion and a bit of fence-sitting\".\n\nWomen and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said Labour's new position is a \"copy and paste\" of the government's position.\n\nAdding that some Labour MPs had previously attacked the Conservative position as prejudiced, she accused the party of \"bare-faced hypocrisy\".Heathrow Airport has said that some passengers may face security delays over the Easter holidays due to strike action over pay.\n\nHundreds of security officers in the Unite union, who work for Heathrow Airport, have begun 10 days of industrial action.\n\nIt threatens disruption at the UK's largest airport at the start of the Easter school holidays.\n\nHowever, Heathrow said the airport was operating \"as normal\" on Friday.\n\nThe strike involves security guards at Terminal 5, which is only used by British Airways, and those who check cargo. Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.\n\nHeathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than \u00a31,000.\n\nThe airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.\n\nHowever, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.\n\nPicket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being \"well supported\".\n\nHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC \"many\" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but \"a lot\" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside \"hundreds\" of managers who were \"here to help\".\n\n\"The airport is operating as normal,\" he said.\n\nAre you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.\n\nThe next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.\n\nAhead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.\n\nBritish Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.\n\nThe strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.\n\nHeathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.\n\nTravellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.\n\nPassengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.\n\nThe aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused", "\n\nIn Scotland, Scottish students are eligible for free tuition, while those from elsewhere in the UK can pay up to \u00a39,250.\n\nDuring his campaign to replace Mr Corbyn as leader in 2020, Sir Keir promised to abolish fees as part of his 10 leadership pledges, under the heading of \"social justice\".\n\nIn his three years as leader, he has also abandoned leadership pledges to nationalise energy and water companies, increase income tax for the top 5% of earners, and \"defend free movement as we leave the EU\".\n\nOn the Today programme, he said the UK now found itself in a \"different situation,\" including by having left the EU and now having the \"highest tax burden\" since the World War II.\n\nHe added he had made a \"political choice\" to abandon the pledge on energy companies, after a review by his team last year found it would \"cost a lot\" but wouldn't reduce bills for households.\n\nMomentum, the left-wing group set up to campaign for Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Sir Keir's move away from free university tuition was a \"betrayal of millions of young people\".\n\nIt added that it would also \"fly in the face of party democracy,\" with Labour's student wing voting two months ago to campaign to scrap fees.\n\nThe Conservative government is in favour of maintaining tuition fees. In January, it said fees would be frozen at \u00a39,250 for the next two years.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats want to bring back maintenance grants, which were abandoned in 2016, and set up a review of how higher education is financed.\n\nThe Green Party, which favours scrapping fees, criticised Sir Keir's move, with co-leader Adrian Ramsay saying students would pay a \"heavy price\" as a result of \"the latest U-turn from Keir Starmer's Labour\".An open letter signed by dozens of academics from around the world calls on artificial-intelligence developers to learn more about consciousness, as AI systems become more advanced.\n\n\"It is no longer in the realm of science fiction to imagine AI systems having feelings and even human-level consciousness,\" it says.\n\nMost experts agree AI is nowhere near this level of sophistication.\n\nBut it is evolving rapidly and some say developments should be paused.\n\nThe term AI covers computer systems able to do tasks that would normally need human intelligence. This includes chatbots able to understand questions and respond with human-like answers, and systems capable of recognising objects in pictures.\n\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), an AI system developed by ChatGPT chatbot creator OpenAI, can now successfully complete the bar exam, the professional qualification for lawyers, although it still makes mistakes and can share misinformation.\n\nBut this is just one function of AI. AI products are being deployed in many sectors, including health research, marketing and finance.\n\nTechnology billionaire Elon Musk co-signed a recent letter saying further AI developments should be put on hold until effective safety measures could be designed and implemented.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, his ex-wife, Tallulah Riley, tweeted artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI capable of human-level intellectual tasks - needed \"the equivalent of [environmental activist] Greta Thunberg\" to raise awareness and encourage public debate.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science (AMCS), which has compiled the open letter, titled \"The responsible development of AI agenda needs to include consciousness research\", said it did not have a view on whether AI development in general should be paused.\n\nBut it pushed for a greater scientific understanding of consciousness, how it could apply to AI and how society might live alongside it.\n\n\"The rapid development of AI is exposing the urgent need to accelerate research in the field of consciousness science,\" the letter says.\n\nIts signatories include Dr Susan Schneider, a former NASA professor, as well as academics from universities in the UK, US and Europe.\n\nLast year, a Google engineer was fired after claiming an AI system was sentient.\n\nGoogle has maintained Lamda was doing exactly what it had been programmed to do - communicate in a human-like way.\n\nBut Google boss Sundar Pichai recently told US news platform CBS he did not \"fully understand\" how Bard worked.\n\nThe human mind was not fully understood either, he added, which is why the AMCS is calling for more research.\n\nBut there is as much excitement as nervousness around AI. It is the big buzzword in big tech and investment money is pouring in to AI-related projects.\n\nReleased in November, ChatGPT, became an instant viral sensation, the populist \"face\" of AI, with millions of people trying it out.\n\nUsing the internet as a database, it can give written answers to questions in a natural, human-like way.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested heavily in OpenAI, says AI can take \"the drudgery\" out of mundane jobs such as office administration.\n\nA recent report by Goldman Sachs suggests AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.\n\nAnd while the AI industry will create new human jobs, they are likely to require new skills.Junior doctors in Scotland have been offered a 14.5% pay rise.\n\nThe new offer from the Scottish government, which covers a two-year period, was made after negotiations with BMA Scotland.\n\nThe union will now consult its members, who voted in favour of strike action earlier this month, on the offer.\n\nBMA Scotland stressed it had not agreed the improved deal - but said that it was likely to be the best that the Scottish government would offer.\n\nMinisters said they were proposing a \u00a361.3m investment in junior doctor pay, which they described as the largest in 20 years and the best offer in the UK.\n\nThe government said that if it was accepted, there would be a pay rise of 6.5% in 2023/24 and an additional 3% towards an already agreed 4.5% uplift in 2022/23.\n\nThis amounts to a cumulative increase of 14.5% over two years and matches the recent pay award accepted by nurses and other NHS workers in 2023, it said.\n\nBMA Scotland members had previously voted in favour of staging a 72-hour walkout. The union has been calling for a 23.5% increase above inflation.\n\nMore than 71% of the eligible 5,000 junior doctors in Scotland voted in that ballot, with 97% in favour of industrial action.\n\nScotland's Health Secretary Michael Matheson said he was \"delighted\" to have reached an agreement with the BMA Scotland after weeks of intense negotiations.\n\nHe added: \"We have taken their concerns regarding pay, and the need to modernise pay bargaining more broadly, extremely seriously.\n\n\"It's now up to junior doctors to reflect on this final offer, and I hope they will accept.\"\n\nBMA Scotland said it would put the offer to its members in a consultative vote.\n\nDr Chris Smith, who chairs its Scottish junior doctor committee, stressed that the BMA had not agreed the deal or accepted any offer.\n\n\"However, the offer that has been made is without doubt an improvement on the 4.5% awarded last year, and the improved offer for 22/23 would represent a slowdown in doctors' pay erosion, which had accelerated up to this point after 15 years of real terms decline,\" he said.\n\n\"Our commitment to the long-term aim of righting that historical wrong remains firmly in place and will continue to be a top priority going forwards.\n\n\"We feel this offer reflects the best that the Scottish government will offer after this series of negotiations. This is why it is essential our members decide our next steps.\"\n\nMichael Matheson said he hoped junior doctors would accept the offer\n\nJunior doctors - fully-qualified medics who are not specialty staff doctors, consultants or GPs - make up 44% of the doctors in the NHS in Scotland.\n\nJunior doctors in England walked out for three days in March and four days in April, leading to the cancellation of more than 196,000 hospital appointments last month.\n\nIn January, ambulance staff belonging to three unions - GMB, Unison and Unite - staged a strike in England and Wales in a dispute over pay", "anger over the planned expansion of the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a tax on polluting vehicles, to outer London boroughs by the capital's Labour mayor.\n\nVisiting a cafe in the constituency, Mr Sunak said it showed that people would vote Conservative when confronted with the \"reality\" of Labour in power.\n\nBut the other two results suggest the Tories face a difficult path to possible victory at the next election, with the party trailing Labour in the polls nationally by significant margins.\n\nAsked what the defeats meant for his party, Mr Sunak replied: \"The message I take away is that we've got to double down, stick to our plan and deliver for people.\"\n\nHe vowed to renew his focus on his government's five flagship priorities of halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing debt and NHS waiting times, and stopping small boat crossings.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Tory MPs to \"row in behind the prime minister,\" adding that \"divided parties don't win elections\".\n\nHowever, a former cabinet minister on the right of the Conservative Party told the BBC the \"eye-watering swings\" in Selby and Somerton showed the party needs a \"complete change of direction\".\n\n\"Uxbridge provides no get-out-of-jail-free card for Rishi,\" they added.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that a failure by the party leadership to act now and change course risks electoral Armageddon.\"\n\nProgress towards the prime minister's pledges has so far been slow, with inflation in particular falling more slowly than predicted by many economists at the start of the year.\n\nConservative chairman Greg Hands conceded there was a \"lot of work still to be done\" to meet the promises, adding they \"weren't designed to be an easy thing to meet\".\n\nTory peer Lord Frost, a former minister, said his party needed to give people \"something to vote for,\" arguing the results were mainly down to its voters staying at home.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, he renewed his calls for the party to promise tax cuts, reduce levels of legal immigration, and delay net zero targets, adding it was currently offering voters policies too similar to Labour's.\n\nLabour won with a 23.7% swing in the rural North Yorkshire seat of Selby and Ainsty, breaking the record for the largest Tory majority it had overturned at a by-election since 1945.\n\nAnd a 29% swing to the Liberal Democrats in the Somerset seat of Somerton and Frome showed they could be a stronger challenger to the Tories in the West Country than at the last election in 2019.\n\nPolling expert Sir John Curtice said the Conservatives' vote share across the three by-elections showed the party was in \"as deep an electoral hole as the opinion polls have been suggesting\".\n\nHe added that its two defeats in Somerset and Yorkshire had both seen tactical voting to eject the Conservatives locally, spelling \"bad news\" for the governing party.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party's victory was \"nothing short of spectacular\", and showed his party were \"back in the West Country\".\n\nHe added that there were 15 south-western seats with smaller Tory majorities, making his party \"best placed\" to defeat the Conservatives in the region.Russia's president has said members of the Wagner mercenary group were fully funded by the state.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Putin, Wagner was given 86.262bn roubles ($1bn) from May 2022 to May 2023 alone for salaries and bonuses, which came from the defence ministry and state budget.\n\nIts leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday after agreeing to leave Russia.\n\nHis arrival was confirmed by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Earlier, a private jet linked to Prigozhin was tracked landing in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\n\nOn Saturday, mercenary troops led by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin took over the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, marched on Moscow and shot down Russian military helicopters and a plane on their way.\n\nTheir mutiny was later aborted after a deal was struck with the help of Mr Lukashenko.\n\nThe Russian authorities said Wagner will be disarmed but its members will escape prosecution over its short-lived rebellion.\n\n\"We always treated fighters and commanders from this group with great respect, because they really showed bravery and heroism,\" said Mr Putin.\n\nHe said authorities would look into how the money paid to Wagner and its leader was spent.\n\nPreparations are under way for the group to hand over its heavy weapons and equipment to the Russian army, the defence ministry said.\n\nCriminal charges have also been dropped against those who took part in the mutiny, according to the FSB security service.\n\nWagner members were facing prosecution for armed insurrection, but the case has been closed because the mutineers had stopped short of actually committing a crime, the FSB said.\n\nIts fighters can either join the regular army, go home or head for Belarus, Mr Putin said on Monday, adding that the fighters were mostly \"patriots\" who had been misled into a criminal adventure.\n\nMr Lukashenko said Belarus has not started building any camps for members of the group, but will accommodate them if they want.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr Putin told Russian troops in Moscow their actions during the mutiny had prevented a \"civil war\" and held a minute's silence for those killed.\n\nHe insisted that the Wagner forces never had the support of the army or the people, although crowds cheered and applauded Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don.\n\nThe treatment of the mercenaries stands in marked contrast to the treatment of opposition politicians and activists, many of whom are in prison simply for speaking out against the war in Ukraine.\n\nOpposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, for example, is serving 25 years for treason.\n\nBy contrast, Wagner chief Prigozhin and the armed men who took part in the rebellion are seemingly being allowed to go free.\n\nPrigozhin has defended his actions, insisting the revolt was not meant to be a challenge to the leadership of Mr Putin.\n\nRather, he described it as a bid to save his mercenary group from being absorbed into the Russian army, and to expose the failures of the country's military leadership.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The day Wagner chief went rogue... in 96 secondsPrince Harry has criticised attempts by Associated Newspapers to have the High Court case thrown out\n\nPrince Harry says he is determined to hold the publisher of the Mail newspapers to account as he says he is \"deeply concerned\" by their \"unchecked power, influence and criminality\".\n\nHis witness statement was disclosed as part of his privacy case against Associated Newspapers.\n\nIn it, he also claimed he was kept out of Royal Family discussions about taking legal action on phone hacking.\n\nHe attended the High Court for a second day of legal arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex and six other claimants, including Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence - the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence - claim their personal information was obtained illegally and used as material for Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday stories.\n\nAssociated Newspapers has dismissed the claims as \"preposterous smears\" based on a \"fishing expedition\".\n\nIn the duke's statement, he criticises attempts by the publisher in court this week to have the case thrown out for legal reasons.\n\n\"Unfair is not a big enough word to describe the fact that Associated is trying at this early stage to prevent me from bringing my claim,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"If the most influential and popular newspaper in the UK can evade justice without there being a trial of my claims, then what does that say about the industry as a whole and the consequences for our great country.\n\n\"I am bringing this claim because I love my country and I remain deeply concerned by the unchecked power, influence and criminality of Associated.\"\n\nThe statement details stories the duke claims were based on private information which had

birth numbers in the Causeway Coast and Glens area have declined year-on-year\n\nBirths will no longer take place at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, County Londonderry, following a decision by the Department of Health (DoH).\n\nThe DoH permanent secretary approved the move to consolidate maternity services at Antrim Area Hospital.\n\nThe Northern Trust had recommended that all births in the area should permanently move to the Antrim site.\n\nAntenatal and postnatal clinics will be retained and enhanced at Causeway Hospital, the department said.\n\nPermanent Secretary Peter May said the decision was made to ensure safe, consistent and sustainable care for mothers and babies in the trust area.\n\nThe recommendation was made by the Northern Trust board following a 14-week public consultation.\n\nThe changes will come into effect from 17 July 2023.\n\nAny women who are due to give birth at Causeway Hospital will be contacted directly by the trust and there is also a helpline to answer any queries from women who are due to give birth at the hospital.\n\nA trust spokeswoman said the decision for all hospital births to go to Antrim Area Hospital was a welcome one.\n\n\"We strongly believe this is the best outcome for women and babies in our care,\" she said.\n\n\"It will allow us to continue providing the highest standard of inpatient maternity care and births at one, dedicated site, with a safer, more sustainable staffing model.\"\n\nThe trust said it recognised it had been an uncertain time for the \"dedicated team of maternity staff at Causeway Hospital and we will be supporting them through this period of transition.\"\n\nThe trust has said birth numbers in the Causeway Coast and Glens Council area have declined year-on-year.\n\nIt expect birth rates to fall in the area by 11% within the next 20 years.\n\nThe trust had said maternity services in the area were \"vulnerable and unsustainable\".\n\nThe Department of Health said: \"[The] unsustainability of the current Causeway maternity unit relates to falling birth numbers at the hospital and associated difficulties of recruiting and retaining consultants and other staff.\"\n\nThe permanent secretary said: \"An overriding priority for our health service must be the provision of safe care for our population.\n\n\"This decision is in the best interests of mothers and babies in the Northern Trust area.\"\n\nAntenatal and postnatal clinics will be retained and enhanced at Causeway Hospital\n\nHe said maintaining the current service across the Causeway and Antrim sites \"would not be sustainable\".\n\n\"Avoiding planned change would simply lead to unplanned and forced change,\" Mr May added.\n\nCauseway maternity unit has become reliant on locum and temporary staff, making the provision of consistent care more difficult.\n\nDr Dave Watkins, medical director of the Northern Health & Social Care Trust and a consultant paediatrician, said: \"Trying to run two services on two sites clearly dilutes the expertise available and the number of staff available.\n\n\"We feel that this is the safest proposal and it allows us to plan forwards for a safe, sustainable and high quality service for our women here in Antrim Hospital.\"\n\nAnne Wilson from the Royal College of Midwives said: \"We are always disappointed whenever there is a reduction in choice for mothers birthing in maternity services - so it is disappointing.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Wilson said she understood the reason behind the decision.\n\n\"I think ultimately safety of mothers and babies especially giving birth is the main goal and priority here,\" she added.\n\nThe Department of Health said: \"Conditions of the approval include making planned capacity changes at Antrim Hospital as outlined in the public consultation.\"\n\nThe trust will also be required to prioritise the development of an interim three-bedded alongside midwife-led unit at Antrim.\n\nA protest was held in Coleraine in May against the cuts to Causeway Hospital maternity services\n\nThe department said this will offer additional capacity in advance of longer-term plans for a new-build women and children's unit.\n\nSetting out the department's decision-making process, Mr May said he had reviewed the trust's consultation outcome in line with its policy and guidance on change or withdrawal of service.\n\n\"It is also consistent with the wider health transformation agenda which acknowledges that changes need to be made to ensure sustainability of services,\" he said.\n\nThe trust said it was committed to maintaining acute services and an Emergency Department at the site.\n\n\"We recognise that the hospital and its staff play a vital role in serving the local community, and we want to enhance rather than diminish that role.\"\n\nThe trust added: \"Causeway Hospital will retain its high quality antenatal and postnatal care which we recognise are critical local services for women.\n\n\"We will also be enhancing these services so that pregnant women will have access to complex antenatal care and clinics at Causeway Hospital.\"\n\nGregory Campbell, the MP for East Londonderry, said he was \"disturbed\" by the trust's explanation for the move.\n\nHe said: \"The inability to staff hospital wards and in this case a maternity unit, points to a planning and management failure more than lack of need in the community.\"\n\nMr Campbell said the Northern Trust and DoH must spell out the sustainability of the Causeway Hospital.\n\nThe proposals had been met with some opposition over the last number of months.\n\nAbout 100 people gathered in Coleraine town centre after the Northern Trust approved the recommendation to remove births from the hospital in May.\n\nIn June Mother-of-three, Heidi Wright from Portrush, said she was concerned about the length of time it would take to travel to Antrim.\n\nIn less than a year, the Northern Trust has managed to deliver a major permanent change to how one of its core services will be delivered with little fuss or opposition.\n\nIn Northern Ireland that is remarkable.\n\nWhile for decades transforming health care has been much talked about, in practice little has happened.\n\nMost recently, and in 2016, Prof Rafael Bengoa said Northern Ireland faced \"a stark choice\".\n\nThe man who chaired the last local healthcare review said people could \"either resist change and see services deteriorate to the point of collapse over time, or embrace transformation and work to create a modern sustainable service\".\n\nAt present, these two contrasting viewpoints are being played out across three different health trusts.\n\nIn the Southern and Western Trusts, resisting change over many years at Daisy Hill and the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) has now triggered a rush to transform how some services are being delivered, a move likened by the BMA to \"falling off the cliff edge\".\n\nSome have said that the change feels \"unplanned and out of control\".\n\nPoliticians have led rallies and debates in protest.\n\nBut in the Northern Trust the picture is different.\n\nOfficials have said that before maternity services get to to the point of \"collapse\" they are implementing change that is planned, deliberate and intentional.\n\nWhile all the health trusts conducted consultations, it seems that Causeway will be able to consolidate all births at Antrim Area Hospital while maintaining an antenatal and post-natal assessment hub at Causeway.\n\nIt hasn't been without some public protest - but nowhere near the extent of that seen in Enniskillen and Newry.\n\nAll other health trusts must be looking to the Northern Trust in wonder.\n\nHow did it do what the Southern and Western trusts couldn't?\n\nThe big difference, it seems, is the lack of political interference at Causeway.\n\nIn 2016, the then health minister - the DUP's Simon Hamilton - said political consensus was key to the future of NI's health service.\n\nIt seems that is much easier said than done.A surgeon who had to amputate a man's arm after a dog attack in Banbridge has said the victim's injuries were almost

October last year.\n\nMr Brown, who amputated the victim's left arm, said his injuries were so severe it was a case of", "party political issue.

You can't live on that.\n\n\"We're being systematically squeezed out of our livelihood by a business model that was foisted upon us, that has created a myriad of problems for everyone up and down the ladder.\"\n\nThe writers' guild, WGA, has proposed a system that regulates the use of AI in the writing process and prevents it being used as source material.\n\nNetflix declined to comment about the job listings, but has previously said AI will not replace the creative process.\n\n\"The best stories are original, insightful and often come from people's own experiences,\" Netflix has said.\n\nThe news of the most recent AI-based job listing was condemned by some striking actors, who must earn $26,470 before being eligible for health insurance benefits.\n\n\"So $900k/yr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for Sag-Aftra health insurance is just ghoulish,\" actor Rob Delaney, told The Intercept.\n\nJavier Grillo-Marxuach, who is best known for the series Lost, accused Netflix of \"pleading poverty while recruiting VERY (more than I've ever made in a year BY FAR) well-paid generals for your soulless army of silicon plagiarists\".\n\nEarlier this week, Netflix announced the launch of a new app - My Netflix - which the company calls \"a one-stop shop tailored to you with easy shortcuts to help you choose what you want to watch\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.A gunman accused of killing 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 has been found guilty by a jury in the US state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe federal trial of Robert Bowers, 50, now moves to the sentencing phase, with the court poised to decide whether he should be given the death penalty.\n\nThe 27 October assault inside the Tree of Life synagogue was the deadliest antisemitic attack in US history.\n\nBowers pleaded not guilty to all 63 charges against him.\n\nThe jury convicted him on all counts after less than a full day of deliberations.\n\nDuring the three-week trial, prosecutors called 60 witnesses as they tried to prove the gunman carried out his attack because of a hatred for Jews.\n\nBowers' defence team did not call any witnesses and did not deny he carried out the attack, but said it was due to a delusional hatred for immigrants and a Jewish non-profit group, not Jewish people.\n\nUS Attorney Mary Hahn said in closing arguments on Thursday that the defendant had \"hunted\" his victims.\n\n\"He outright told Swat operators he went to the synagogue to kill Jews,\" she said.\n\nDefence attorney Elisa Long had argued that \"stopping religious study was not his intent or motive\".\n\nThe distinction is important because under US federal law, in order for the jury to impose the death penalty prosecutors must prove that Bowers was motivated by race hate or killed people to stop them exercising their religious beliefs.\n\nA psychiatric evaluation of Bowers has been prepared by the government, and the state of his mental health may be raised during the sentencing.\n\nThat hearing will begin on 26 June and is expected to last six weeks.\n\nThe 11 worshippers who died in the attack ranged in age from 54 to 97.

Watch: Michael Gove says the Ukraine war and Covid pandemic made the UK poorer\n\nThe UK is poorer than it would have been, partly due to the war in Ukraine, but also the pandemic, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has admitted.\n\nBut he said ministers were taking action on the soaring cost of living, including giving help on energy bills.\n\nThe head of the independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said living standards were seeing their biggest squeeze on record.\n\nRichard Hughes said Brexit had been similar to the pandemic in its impact.\n\n\"It's a shock to the UK economy of the order of magnitude to other shocks that we've seen from the pandemic, from the energy crisis,\" he told the BBC.\n\nPoor productivity had also hurt growth, he said.\n\nAnd he warned living standards would not return to pre-pandemic levels for another five to six years.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with the OBR's assessments, Mr Gove said economic forecasting was \"a very difficult exercise\". He added that the UK was dealing with \"the aftershocks of two significant events\".\n\n\"[There's] both the war in Ukraine, the first time we've had war on this scale on the continent in Europe since the Second World War, and the Covid pandemic, the biggest global health pandemic since the end of the First World War,\" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\n\"They have had a huge effect on our economy and on others' economies.\"\n\nMr Gove denied that the government was to blame after 13 years in power, but added: \"One can always do better, yes.\"\n\nHowever, he insisted ministers were taking action to address soaring inflation - the rate at which prices rise - by taxing oil and gas firms' profits and lowering household energy bills.\n\nHe also said the Budget had taken steps to help people back to work and to help families, including with childcare.\n\nThe OBR forecasts that inflation will fall below 3% this year - down from 10.4% currently - as food and energy prices rise less quickly.\n\nBut speaking on the same programme, OBR chairman Richard Hughes said the outlook was volatile given Britain was a net importer of food and energy - the prices of which were set in global markets.\n\nMr Hughes added that the longer term outlook for the economy was bleak, with people's real spending power - allowing for inflation - not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade.\n\nMr Hughes blamed a range of issues for holding back the economy, saying: \"We've lost around 500,000 people from the labour force, we've seen stagnant investment since 2016 and also our productivity has slowed dramatically since the financial crisis and not really recovered.\"\n\nHe also said that overall output was forecast to be 4% lower than it would have been as a result of leaving the EU.\n\nLast week the Bank of England put up interest rates for the 11th time since December 2021 as it continued its battle to ease inflation.\n\nThe decision to lift rates to 4.25% from 4% came after the inflation rate rose unexpectedly last month to 10.4%.Steve Rodhouse - who has since gone on to work for the National Crime Agency - was a senior figure at the Met\n\nThe officer who led a disastrous Scotland Yard investigation into false VIP sex abuse allegations has a case to answer for gross misconduct, the police watchdog has said.\n\nSteve Rodhouse ran an operation that probed invented claims that MPs and generals abused and murdered children.\n\nHe currently works as deputy head of the National Crime Agency.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) looked at if he used inaccurate or dishonest words in 2016.\n\nWhile working for the Met, he oversaw Operation Midland, which was largely based on claims made by Carl Beech, who was jailed in 2019 for making false allegations.\n\nBeech was sentenced to 18 years in prison for 12 charges of perverting the course of justice, one of fraud, and for several child sexual offences.\n\nHe was only brought to justice after a damning review by retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques recommended he be investigated by another police force.\n\nBut the BBC revealed two other complainants who made false claims were not referred by the Met for investigation, despite Sir Richard recommending they should be.\n\nIn 2016, then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse told Sir Richard in a private presentation that he was \"satisfied\" the other two complainants had \"told deliberate lies\".\n\nHowever, when Operation Midland closed months earlier, Scotland Yard issued a public statement to the media which said detectives had \"not found evidence to prove that they were knowingly misled by a complainant\".\n\nCarl Beech was jailed for inventing the elaborate lies which led to the investigation\n\nThe investigation by the IOPC related to the contrast between Mr Rodhouse's private and public positions.\n\nScotland Yard said \"we will seek to respond as fully and comprehensively as possible when we receive the final directions and recommendations from the IOPC\".\n\nThe force added that, in January this year, it arranged for West Midlands Police to consider all relevant material relating to the two complainants and advise on further investigation.\n\nThe IOPC inquiry followed a complaint by former MP Harvey Proctor, who was one of those falsely accused of murder and abuse.\n\nResponding to the update, he said: \"At last a senior police officer of the Metropolitan Police is being held to account for gross misconduct\".\n\nHe added: \"As cracks start to appear in the police cover-up, it now time to hold a full public inquiry into Operation Midland and the Metropolitan Police's conduct.\"\n\nIOPC Director Amanda Rowe said Mr Rodhouse \"may have breached police professional standards of behaviour relating to honesty and integrity regarding comments made to the media about Operation Midland in March 2016 and comments subsequently made to Sir Richard Henriques in August 2016.\"\n\nThe IOPC also found that, by never following Sir Richard's original recommendation, the service provided by the Met was \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe Met had conducted several internal reviews which all said no investigation was needed, but the IOPC found those reviews were \"flawed, did not consider all of the evidence and their rationales were not sound.\"\n\nThe watchdog has recommended the Met apologise to the individuals affected.\n\nBecause Mr Rodhouse left the Met more than 12 months before the IOPC investigation began, the watchdog said it would now enter into a consultation period regarding a disciplinary hearing.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it would engage with the IOPC \"fully on this matter\".Corfu has become the latest Greek island to issue an evacuation order, as the country grapples with wildfires.\n\nPhotos uploaded to social media show flames engulfing Corfu. A fire broke out on the northern part of the island which is popular with British tourists.\n\nIt comes after some 19,000 people were evacuated on the island of Rhodes, which has also been hit by fires.\n\nMany were forced to flee their hotels as the flames continued to spread from the centre of the Greek island.\n\nGreece has been grappling with searing heat, with temperatures exceeding 40C across the country, and fires have blazed for nearly a week in some areas.\n\nA national holiday that had been planned for Monday has been cancelled \"in view of the extraordinary conditions prevailing in the country due to the fires\", the Greek presidency said.\n\nLate on Sunday evening Greece's Emergency Communications Service published evacuation orders for a number of areas of Corfu.\n\nPeople in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia", "for tax fraud, he was back in parliament, elected to Italy's Senate before he turned 86 in September 2022.\n\nBut it was often his private life - his fondness for surrounding himself with beautiful young women, and the ensuing sexual scandals - that made headlines around the world.\n\nBerlusconi, who has died at the age of 86, was a media mogul, football club owner and billionaire businessman who never gave up on politics - and helped shape Italy's image for decades.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi was born into a middle-class family in Milan on 29 September 1936 and grew up in a village outside the city during World War Two.\n\nFrom his student days, he demonstrated the ability to make money. While studying law at university, he played double-bass in a student band - and developed a reputation as a singer, working in nightclubs and on cruise ships.\n\nBerlusconi had a spell as a singer on cruise ships\n\nHis first foray into using his natural charm for business was as a vacuum cleaner salesman and in selling essays written for his fellow students.\n\nAfter graduation, he started in construction with his own company, Edilnord, building an enormous apartment complex on the edge of Milan - though the source of funding for the project was something of a mystery.\n\nIn 1973, the entrepreneur launched a local cable television company called Telemilano to provide television to his properties.\n\nFour years later, he owned two more stations and a central Milan studio. By the end of the decade, he had created a holding company, Fininvest, to manage the rapid expansion of his business holdings.\n\nEventually, it would own Mediaset - Italy's largest media empire and owner of the country's biggest private stations - and Italy's largest publishing house, Mondadori.\n\nBy the time of his death, he was one of Italy's richest men, with a family fortune in the billions of dollars. His children - Marina, Barbara, Pier Silvio, Eleonora and Luigi - have all taken part in the running of his business empire.\n\nSome of that wealth would be used to indulge his personal interests - including saving his hometown football club AC Milan from bankruptcy in 1986.\n\nThe football club AC Milan was just one of his business interests\n\nThat investment would pay off three decades later in 2017, when he sold the club to Chinese investors for \u00a3628m (\u20ac740m).\n\nHe never gave up on football either, later buying Monza football club and enjoying its rise to the top flight of Serie A for the first time in its history.\n\nBerlusconi's remarkable ability to face down the courts repeatedly - and maintain his popularity in politics - was unrivalled.\n\nHe often complained of victimisation - particularly by prosecutors in his native Milan - once claiming to have made 2,500 court appearances in 106 trials over 20 years.\n\nCharges over the years have included embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting, and attempting to bribe a judge. He was acquitted or had his convictions overturned on several occasions.\n\nHis controversies were highly public and formed a regular backdrop throughout his political career. It was not until February 2023 that he was finally cleared of bribing witnesses to lie about the notorious \"bunga bunga\" parties he had held at his villa as prime minister.\n\nHe had founded his own political party 30 years earlier in 1993 and within a year, he was catapulted to power.\n\nLeveraging his enthusiasm for football, he named his party after a supporters' chant - Forza Italia (Go Italy). At the time, a power vacuum had emerged in the wake of a scandal affecting Italy's centre-right - and Berlusconi offered an alternative to those voters that was not leftist.\n\nA massive advertising campaign on his own TV channels had helped propel him to victory in the 1994 election.\n\nHowever, his new appetite for politics was seen as a bid to avoid being implicated in corruption charges himself, after several of his businesses were drawn into the investigation.\n\nBut he dismissed the claims. \"I don't need to go into office for the power. I have houses all over the world, stupendous boats, beautiful airplanes, a beautiful wife, a beautiful family. I am making a sacrifice.\"\n\nOnce he was in power, Berlusconi's government passed a law that gave him, and other top public figures, immunity from prosecution while in office, but it was later thrown out by the constitutional court.\n\nBerlusconi's first coalition lasted only a few months - partly owing to friction between the different parties in it, and partly because of Berlusconi's indictment for alleged tax fraud by a Milan court.\n\nHe lost the 1996 election to the Left - but his political career was only just beginning.\n\nIn 2001, Berlusconi was back as prime minister, at the head of a new coalition known as House of Freedoms. The main plank of his election campaign was a promise to overhaul the Italian economy, simplify the tax system and raise pensions.\n\nBut Italy's finances were suffering in a worsening global economy, and Berlusconi was unable to fulfil his pledges. He lost to the Left in 2006 - but won again in 2008.\n\nHe remained a fixture in Italian politics until 2011, which would prove among his most challenging years.\n\nItaly's borrowing costs soared during the eurozone debt crisis. The prime minister haemorrhaged support and was forced to resign after losing his parliamentary majority.\n\nThe same year, the constitutional court struck down part of the law granting him and other senior ministers temporary immunity.\n\nBerlusconi eventually carried out community service as part of his conviction for tax fraud\n\nBy the end of 2011, he was out of power. In October 2012, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for tax fraud and barred from public office. Berlusconi declared his innocence and spoke of a \"judicial coup\".\n\nBut by then, he was over 75 years of age and was handed community service instead. He worked four hours a week with elderly dementia patients at a Catholic care home near Milan.\n\nHe was also banned from public office - a prohibition which lasted for several years before his next comeback.\n\nBeyond politics, Berlusconi made headlines for his private life, which was often very public.\n\nThe flamboyant prime minister did not hide his pursuit of younger women. His most recent partner, party colleague Marta Fascina, is more than 50 years his junior. He was known to use hair transplants and plastic surgery to make himself seem younger.\n\nHe met his second wife, Veronica Lario, after she performed topless in a play. She would go on to express frustration publicly with her husband's behaviour around young women on more than one occasion.\n\nShe filed for divorce after her husband was photographed at the 18th birthday party of model Noemi Letizia.\n\nHis most high-profile scandal was the alleged \"bunga bunga\" parties at his villa, attended by showgirls - a story which ended in a conviction for paying an underage prostitute for sex.\n\nAmid the scandal, both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug denied they had sex\n\nIt eventually emerged that in 2010, Berlusconi, while prime minister, had telephoned a police station and asked for the release of 17-year-old Karima \"Ruby\" El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby Heart-Stealer, who was being held for theft. She was also a reported guest of the \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nItalian media reported that the prime minister had claimed the girl was the niece or granddaughter of the president of Egypt, and he was attempting to avoid a diplomatic incident.\n\nBerlusconi was found guilty of paying her for sex and abusing his power in 2013 - but that ruling was overturned the following year.\n\nFor his part, Berlusconi always rejected claims he had paid any woman for sex, saying to do so was \"missing the pleasure of conquest\". But he also admitted he was \"no saint\".\n\nBeset by national budgetary problems and embroiled in personal scandals, Berlusconi's People of Freedom party did poorly in 2011 local elections, losing", "are working to avoid civilian casualties, accuses Hamas of deliberately putting civilians in the line of fire and has said there are no limits on aid deliveries.\n\nThe US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel's arms imports between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe US provides Israel with $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) in annual military aid under a 10-year agreement that is intended to allow its ally to maintain what it calls a \"qualitative military edge\" over neighbouring countries.\n\nIsrael has used the grants to finance orders of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, a stealth aircraft considered the most advanced ever made. It has so far ordered 75 and taken delivery of more than 30 of the aircraft. It was the first country other than the US to receive an F-35 and the first to use one in combat.\n\nPart of the aid - $500m annually - is set aside to fund missile defence programmes, including the jointly developed Iron Dome, Arrow and David's Sling systems. Israel has relied on them during the war to defend itself against rocket, missile and drone attacks by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, as well as other Iran-backed armed groups based in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the days after Hamas's 7 October attack, President Joe Biden said the US was \"surging additional military assistance\" to Israel.\n\nSince the start of the war, only two US military sales to Israel have been made public after receiving emergency approval - one for 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth $106m and the other for $147m of components to make 155mm artillery shells.\n\nBut US media report that President Joe Biden's administration has also quietly made more than 100 military sales to Israel, most falling below the dollar amount that would require Congress to be formally notified. They are said to include thousands of precision-guided munitions, small-diameter bombs, bunker busters and small arms.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome batteries help protect cities and towns from rocket and missile fire\n\nHowever, SIPRI's report says that despite the deliveries, the total volume of Israeli arms imports from the US in 2023 was almost the same as in 2022.\n\nOne deal that is large enough to require Congressional notification is the $18bn sale of up to 50 F-15 fighter jets, news about which emerged this week. Congress has not yet approved the deal.\n\nEven though the aircraft would need to be built from scratch and would not be delivered immediately, the sale is expected to be hotly debated by Mr Biden's Democratic Party, many of whose representatives in Congress and supporters are increasingly concerned by Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has said she is prepared to block the deal and has accused Israel of \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza.\n\nGermany is the next biggest arms exporter to Israel, accounting for 30% of imports between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI.\n\nAs of early November, the European nation's weapons sales to Israel last year were worth \u20ac300m ($326m; $257m) - a 10-fold increase compared with 2022 - with the majority of those export licences granted after the 7 October attacks.\n\nComponents for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has been a staunch supporter of Israel's right to self-defence throughout the war and, although his tone on Israeli actions in Gaza has shifted in recent weeks and there has been some debate in Germany, the arms sales do not appear to be at risk of suspension.\n\nIsrael rejects accusations that it is failing to do enough to protect civilians in Gaza and instead blames Hamas\n\nItaly is the third-biggest arms exporter to Israel, but it accounted for only 0.9% of Israeli imports between 2019 and 2023. They have reportedly included helicopters and naval artillery.\n\nThe sales amounted to \u20ac13.7m ($14.8m; \u00a311.7m) last year, according to national statistics bureau ISTAT.\n\nSome \u20ac2.1m of exports were approved between October and December, despite the government's assurances that it was blocking them under a law which bans weapons sales to countries that are waging war or are deemed to be violating human rights.\n\nDefence Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament last month that Italy had honoured existing contracts after checking them on a case-by-case basis and ensuring \"they did not concern materials that could be used against civilians\".\n\nThe UK's arms exports to Israel are \"relatively small\", according to the UK government, amounting to only \u00a342m ($53m) in 2022.\n\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth \u00a3574m ($727m) in total.\n\nMuch of those are for components used in US-made warplanes that end up in Israel. But the British government is coming under growing pressure to suspend even those exports.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK has a \"very careful export licensing regime\" and said Israel must \"act in accordance with international humanitarian law\". The UK government is also preparing an assessment that will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law in its actions from early 2024.\n\nBut a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was \"not going to happen\".\n\nThe government of Canada, whose arms sales to Israel were worth 21.3m Canadian dollars ($15.7m; \u00a312.4m) in 2022, said in January that it had suspended approving new exit permits for weapons until it could ensure they were being used in accordance with Canadian law. However, pre-existing permits remained valid.\n\nIsrael's Elbit Systems developed the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being used in Gaza\n\nIsrael has also built up its own defence industry with US help and now ranks as the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world, with a focus on advanced technological products rather than large-scale hardware.\n\nIt held a 2.3% share of global sales between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI, with India (37%), the Philippines (12%) and the US (8.7%) the three main recipients. The sales were worth $12.5bn (\u00a39.9bn) in 2022, according to the Israeli defence ministry.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made up 25% of those exports, followed by missiles, rockets and air defence systems (19%) and radar and electronic warfare systems (13%), the ministry said.\n\nIn September, just before the war began, Germany agreed a $3.5bn deal with Israel to buy the sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defence system, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles. The deal - Israel's largest-ever - had to be approved by the US because it jointly developed the system.\n\nThe US has reportedly allowed Israel to draw artillery shells from its reserve stockpile there\n\nIsrael is also home to a vast US arms depot set up in 1984 to pre-position supplies for its troops in case of a regional conflict, as well as to give Israel quick access to weapons in emergencies.\n\nThe Pentagon shipped about 300,000 155mm artillery shells from the War Reserve Stockpile Ammunition-Israel to Ukraine following the Russian invasion.\n\nStockpiled munitions at the depot have also reportedly been supplied to Israel since the start of the Gaza war.House price growth was \"subdued\" last month as higher mortgage rates affected affordability, the Nationwide has said.\n\nProperty prices rose 1.6% on average from March 2023, but fell 0.2% compared with the February, the UK's largest building society said.\n\nWhile mortgage rates have fallen from peaks seen last summer,", "As the weather improved, they just swarmed like mad,\" he added.\n\nProfessor David Chandler, a microbiologist and entomologist at Warwick University said: \"We only have honeybees now because of beekeepers.\n\n\"There are no wild honeybees in this country because honeybees are affected by a parasitic mite which feeds on their blood - it's an invasive species.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He was released after 16 hours in custody and said there was \"no longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK\".\n\nOther concerns have been raised over reports three volunteers with a Westminster-based women's safety programme had been arrested while handing out rape alarms.\n\nThe Met said it received intelligence protesters were planning to use rape alarms to disrupt coronation proceedings.\n\nMs Frazer said the right to protest was \"really important\" and people should be heard but there had been a recent change in protesters' tactics.\n\nProtesters have been stopping people going about their day-to-day lives, she said, and there was a need to redress that balance.\n\nOfficers would have made operational decisions on a case-by-case basis, she said, taking into account the scale of the Coronation celebrations.\n\n\"We were on the global stage, there were 200 foreign dignitaries in the UK, in London at an event, millions of people watching and hundreds of thousands of people at the scene,\" she added.\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC he was reassured the Met were aware of a gap in public confidence over policing and the force was \"explaining and justifying\" why they made some of the arrests.\n\nHe said Labour would \"wait and see\" whether the force got the balance right, adding \"accountability\" over policing decisions was important.\n\nMr Streeting said if they did not get it right, it was important to \"hold your hands up\".\n\nThe King and Queen went past some protesters on their way to Westminster Abbey for the Coronation ceremony\n\nMetropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay defended her officers' response, saying they had a duty to intervene \"when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption\".\n\nShe added the Coronation was a \"once-in-a-generation event\" which was a key consideration in their assessment.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered in the rain in central London on Saturday, with chants including \"down with the Crown\", \"don't talk to the police\" and \"get a real job\".\n\nBut Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said some of the arrests \"raise questions\" over the Met's actions, adding he has \"sought urgent clarity\" whilst investigations are ongoing.\n\nOther protests were organised in Cardiff, Glasgow and Edinburgh. No arrests were reported outside London.\n\nWhile campaigners insisted their protest", "will of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe Scottish government is to launch a legal challenge to Westminster's block on its controversial gender reforms.\n\nThe proposals, which would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex, were passed by the Scottish Parliament in December last year.\n\nBut they were blocked by the UK government over their potential impact on UK-wide equality laws.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has previously described that move as an \"undemocratic veto\".\n\nHe was the only one of the three candidates in the SNP leadership contest who backed taking legal action in an attempt to overturn the block.\n\nHis predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, had described the block as a \"full-frontal attack on our democratically-elected Scottish Parliament\" and said that legal action was inevitable.\n\nShirley-Anne Somerville, Scotland's social justice secretary, said the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill had been passed by an \"overwhelming majority of the Scottish Parliament, with support from members of all parties\".\n\nShe said the block by the UK government was an \"unprecedented challenge to the Scottish Parliament's ability to legislate on clearly devolved matters\".\n\nMs Somerville added: \"To uphold the democratic decision of the parliament, and ensure proper protection of devolution, Scottish ministers will now lodge a petition for judicial review of the secretary of state's decision.\n\nShe is expected to make a statement to the Scottish Parliament after the Easter break setting out details of her plans for a court challenge.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has described the block as undemocratic\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the UK government's decision to block the gender recognition reforms, saying it had been based on \"very careful and considered advice\".\n\nHe added: \"We had concerns about how Scotland's gender recognition act would interact with reserved powers, about the operation of the Equalities Act, the protection of women elsewhere in the UK as well.\n\n\"Obviously there's a court process, we will follow that through.\"\n\nThe gender reforms have been divisive within the SNP, with another of the leadership candidates, Ash Regan, resigning from the government last year over her fears about their impact on safeguards for women and girls.\n\nA recent opinion poll by Panelbase for the Sunday Times suggested that 18% of Scottish voters think Mr Yousaf should launch a legal challenge, while 44% said that he should abandon the reforms and 24% believed a compromise should be found with the UK government.\n\nShortly after the reforms were passed, double rapist Isla Bryson - who changed gender after being arrested for attacking two women - was remanded to a women's jail.\n\nBryson was subsequently moved to a male prison after the case sparked widespread anger. Ministers insisted the new legislation had no impact on the decision about where Bryson was held.\n\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher claimed that the legal challenge was a \"painfully transparent attempt by Humza Yousaf to divert attention from the civil war engulfing the SNP and the huge question marks over the party's finances\".\n\nBut the Scottish Greens, who have a power sharing agreement with the SNP, said the move was \"vital for equality and democracy\".\n\nHe's barely got his feet under the table at Bute House, but Humza Yousaf has already been pitched into a constitutional showdown with the UK government.\n\nThere is an extent to which the new first minister has been painted into a corner here. He only had until Monday to decide whether to challenge the UK government's unprecedented veto of Holyrood's gender reforms.\n\nHis SNP leadership campaign also promised to maintain the partnership with the Greens - and anything short of a full-throated defence of the reforms would have seen them walk.\n\nBut Mr Yousaf has also signed up to this fight completely voluntarily.\n\nHe deliberately founded much of his leadership platform on social justice issues, and said he would continue the agenda started by Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nAnd while crafting his own identity as first minister, he will not want to start by shying away from a confrontation with UK ministers on the topic of Holyrood's powers.\n\nIt is a risky strategy given how this issue has divided his party. But this is a battle Mr Yousaf is now fully committed to.\n\nMr Yousaf has previously said he would only launch a court challenge to the UK government's block if he was given legal advice that it stood a chance of succeeding.\n\nBut former Supreme Court judge Lord Hope has said the Scottish government's chances of winning a court case are \"very low\".\n\nThe former deputy president of the Supreme Court said the Scottish legislation \"most certainly does\" impact on the Equality Act 2010 and the existing Gender Recognition Act 2004, which currently apply across Great Britain.\n\nAnd he said it was difficult to see how a court would not agree that Scottish Secretary Alister Jack had \"acted reasonably\" in blocking the reforms through the use of a Section 35 order.\n\nThe Scottish secretary is able to use a Section 35 to block legislation passed by Holyrood if he believes it would have a detrimental impact on areas that are reserved to Westminster.\n\nIt is the first time a Section 35 has been used since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.\n\nFormer SNP minister Alex Neil told BBC Scotland earlier on Wednesday that \"every lawyer I have spoken to has told me we don't have a cat in hell's chance of winning\" a legal battle.\n\nHe said Mr Yousaf should instead focus on reintroducing the legislation after its \"deficiencies\" had been addressed.\n\nOpponents of the gender reforms are concerned about their potential impact on single-sex spaces and other protections for women and girls\n\nSusan Smith, co-director of the For Women Scotland group - which opposes the gender self-identification reforms - said Mr Yousaf was \"remarkably foolish\" to take legal action over legislation that is \"wildly unpopular\".\n\nShe added: \"It is widely predicted that they will lose, so it seems like an incredible waste of everybody's time and money to go through this when there are other really pressing matters\".\n\nHowever, the announcement of a legal challenge was welcomed by Vic Valentine, the manager of Scottish Trans, who said the UK government's block was \"unacceptable\".\n\nThey added: \"Other countries all over the world have introduced similar laws, with the only impact being a positive one.\"\n\nColin Macfarlane, the director of nations at Stonewall, said the UK government's \"unprecedented\" block had \"made clear that they see trans people as a threat to be contained rather than people to be treated with dignity and respect\".\n\nThe reforms are intended to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex by doing away with the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria - a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity.\n\nApplicants for a gender recognition certificate would need to have lived in their acquired gender for three months rather than the current two years.\n\nAnd the minimum age that someone can apply to change their sex will be cut from 18 to 16 - although 16 and 17-year-olds would need to have lived as their acquired gender for six months rather than three.Ukraine's army has released footage appearing to show drones delivering water bottles to people stranded by floodwaters in Russian-controlled areas of the Kherson region.\n\nWater from the destroyed Kakhovka dam has engulfed the area, causing thousands to flee and sparking a humanitarian disaster.\n\nRead the latest on the dam disaster here.More children are thought to be absent from school on Fridays\n\nSome pupils have missed school on Fridays since the pandemic because their parents are at home, England's children's commissioner has said.\n\nThe number of pupils regularly missing school in England remains higher than pre-Covid levels.\n\nDame Rachel de Souza told MPs there was \"a huge amount\" of absence on Fridays - when \"mum and dad are at home\" - that \"wasn't there before\".\n\nThe government said it is providing help for regularly absent children.\n\nPupils count as persistently absent if they miss 10% or more of school sessions, which would amount to seven days in the autumn term.\n\nDame Rachel told the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday that 818,000 of the 1.6 million children who were persistently absent across the autumn and spring terms in 2021", "said he was \"shocked by the unprecedented attack\".\n\nThe Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nInternational food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is suspending its operations in Gaza following the death of seven of its workers in an Israeli air strike.\n\nThree of the killed aid workers were British citizens, WCK said.\n\nThe charity said those killed were part of an aid convoy that was leaving a warehouse in central Gaza on Monday.\n\nWCK is one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza. It said that it would \"be making decisions about the future of [its] work soon\".\n\nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route.\"\n\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured. The BBC understands that all three were hit in the strike.\n\nWCK said it had co-ordinated the convoy's movements with the IDF when it was hit.\n\nA Palestinian medical source told the BBC the workers had been wearing bullet-proof vests bearing the WCK logo.\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had recovered all seven bodies from the scene of the incident following a \"challenging operation spanning several hours\".\n\nThe humanitarian group added that the bodies had been taken to the Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital in southern Gaza in preparation for their evacuation through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt.\n\nMr Netanyahu released a video message on Tuesday in which he said Israeli forces were behind the attack.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours there was a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip,\" he said.\n\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.\"\n\nThe IDF had earlier said it was conducting a thorough review at the highest level to understand the circumstances of the \"tragic incident\".\n\n\"We will get to the bottom of this and we will share our findings transparently,\" IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari vowed.\n\n\"The work of WCK is critical; they are on the frontlines of humanity.\"\n\nMr Hagari added that the IDF had been \"working closely with the World Central Kitchen to assist them in fulfilling their noble mission of helping bring food and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza\".\n\nAccording to WCK, the workers who died were Australian, Polish, British, Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen.\n\n\"I am heartbroken and appalled that we - World Central Kitchen and the world - lost beautiful lives today because of a targeted attack by the IDF,\" the charity's chief executive Erin Gore said in a statement.\n\n\"The love they had for feeding people, the determination they embodied to show that humanity rises above all, and the impact they made in countless lives will forever be remembered and cherished.\"\n\nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of co-ordinating aid deliveries to Gaza, the charity is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\n\nWCK said in a recent statement that it had served more than 42 million meals to people in Gaza since October and had been ready to provide more than one million more.\n\nThe charity recently made headlines for providing hundreds of tonnes of food for Gazans that was transported on the first aid ship in March.\n\nAid agencies have started delivering aid by sea in order to increase the amount getting into the territory, which the UN says is on the brink of famine.\n\nBut following the deadly strike, a second US-based charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has confirmed that aid worker Lalzawmi \"Zomi\" Frankcom was among those killed and has offered his condolences to family and friends.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \"This is someone who was volunteering overseas to provide aid through this charity for people who are suffering tremendous deprivation in Gaza. And this is just completely unacceptable.\"\n\nHe said Australia expected \"full accountability\", adding that it was a \"tragedy that should never have occurred\".\n\nWojciech Bakun, the mayor of the Polish city of Przemysl, said that Damian Sob\u00f3l, who was from the area, was also among those killed.\n\nMr Bakun described Mr Sob\u00f3l as a \"fantastic boy\", adding that no words could describe the feelings of those who knew him.\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry said it had received reports of the incident and was seeking urgent official confirmation from the Israeli government about the victim's identity.\n\n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the family of the Polish volunteer who was providing aid to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said it was was urgently seeking further information about the incident.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urged Israel to \"immediately investigate and provide a full, transparent explanation of what happened\".\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said she expected \"full accountability\" for the killings, adding that strikes on humanitarian personnel were \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\nThe Palestinian killed in Monday's strike has been named as Saif Abu Taha - the driver of one of the cars in the convoy that was struck.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said on X: \"We are heartbroken and deeply troubled by the strike that killed [WCK] aid workers in Gaza.\n\n\"Humanitarian aid workers must be protected as they deliver aid that is desperately needed, and we urge Israel to swiftly investigate what happened.\"\n\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\n\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\n\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\n\nMore than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nThe locations of where WCK vehicles were hitChatGPT can answer questions using natural, human-like language and mimic other writing styles\n\nA New York lawyer is facing a court hearing of his own after his firm used AI tool ChatGPT for legal research.\n\nA judge said the court was faced with an \"unprecedented circumstance\" after a filing was found to reference example legal cases that did not exist.\n\nThe lawyer who used the tool told the court he was \"unaware that its content could be false\".\n\nChatGPT creates original text on request, but comes with warnings it can \"produce inaccurate information\".\n\nThe original case involved a man suing an airline over an alleged personal injury. His legal team submitted a brief that cited several previous court cases in an attempt to prove, using precedent, why the case should move forward.\n\nBut the airline's lawyers later wrote to the judge to say they could not find several of the cases that were referenced in the brief.\n\n\"Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations,\" Judge Castel wrote in an order demanding the man's legal team explain itself.\n\nOver the course of several filings, it emerged that the research had not been prepared by Peter LoDuca, the lawyer for the plaintiff, but by a colleague of his at the same law firm. Steven A Schwartz, who has been an attorney for more than 30 years, used ChatGPT to look for similar previous cases.\n\nIn his written statement, Mr Schwartz clarified that Mr LoDuca had not been part of the research and had no knowledge of how it had been carried out.\n\nMr", ".\n\nMs Kitson said: \"We want there to be a legal duty of care within all higher education institutions, and I think some people, including our government, seem to think there is some legal requirement in place but there really isn't.\n\n\"You want to know that if your child is suffering with any kind of mental health issues, or is overwhelmed by university life, there are people there who are trained and skilled to help deal with it.\n\n\"And if they really, really are in a state of crisis you would want to be informed.\"\n\nLibby Kitson hopes the Scottish government will legislate after the UK government\n\nCampaigners from ForThe100 want a change in law to ensure higher education institutions have a legal duty of care towards their students, as schools already do.\n\nThe Department of Education has said creating a legally enforced duty of care \"would be a disproportionate response\".\n\nMs Kitson said the campaign was not looking to provide a means for families to sue universities, but to prevent similar deaths.\n\nShe said she did not want any other parent to have to go through the same situation.\n\n\"We would hope that the Scottish Parliament would look at England and Wales and think 'they've led by example, we should follow suit',\" she said.\n\n\"A Scottish student's life is no less important.\"\n\nA University of Edinburgh spokeswoman said it had been \"shocked and deeply saddened by what happened\" to Romy and \"deeply sorry\" for the gaps in support given to her.\n\n\"Supporting our students' mental health and ensuring their wellbeing is our absolute priority,\" she said. \"Our support policies and practices are under regular review as we continue to focus and improve upon our mental health support provision and provide the best possible environment for our students.\"\n\nStudents at the university now have access to a \"named-contact relationship\" with staff trained in wellbeing and mental health, alongside other support services.\n\nThe spokeswoman added: \"We continue to engage with students through both the Students' Association and the Sports Union to identify how best we can shape and develop our services to support students most effectively.\n\n\"We work closely with the three other universities in Edinburgh and NHS mental health colleagues to improve pathways into specialist mental health services for students.\"\n\nThe Department for Education previously responded to the petition by saying that higher education providers already had a \"general duty of care not to cause harm to their students through their own actions\".\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the profound and lasting impact a young person's suicide has upon their family and friends, and know among the petitioners there are those who have personal experience of these devastating, tragic events.\n\n\"[However] we... feel further legislation to create a statutory duty of care, where such a duty already exists, would be a disproportionate response.\"\n\nIn a response to the petition, the Scottish government said: ''We are determined to support the mental health of all students.

Iranians sending missiles and drones to Russia could also be sanctioned.\n\nThe Foreign Office said Iran had increased its efforts \"to kill or kidnap individuals perceived to be enemies of the regime outside of Iran, including in the UK\".\n\nUnder the new regime, Iranians could also be sanctioned for undermining \"peace, stability and security in the Middle East and internationally\", for using or spreading \"weapons or weapons technologies from Iran\", and undermining democracy, rule of law and good governance.\n\nThe Foreign Office said legislation establishing the new sanctions regime would be put before parliament later this year.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly said the move showed that \"the UK has sent a clear message to the regime - we will not tolerate this malign behaviour and we will hold you to account\".\n\n\"Our new sanctions regime will help to ensure there can be no hiding place for those who seek to do us harm,\" he added.\n\nLabour has asked Mr Cleverly for an update on the proscription of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nShadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the Commons: \"The government will be aware of the long-standing strength of feeling from many sides of the House and from members of the Iranian diaspora on the question of proscription of the IRGC...\n\n\"I understand, of course, that there are diplomatic dimensions to this question, but I'm sure this House would welcome an update from him on the issue.\"The Prince of Wales took an unsuspecting customer's booking on the telephone as he and the Princess of Wales visited an Indian street food restaurant in Birmingham.\n\nPrince William answered the unexpected phone call and took a booking for two while he and Catherine were being served a range of Indian dishes at the Indian Streatery in Bennetts Hill.\n\nThe customer was Vinay Aggarwal who visited the restaurant with his wife Ankita Gulati on Thursday afternoon and said he was stunned at the Royal's involvement.\n\n\"I didn't recognise his voice at all, this is the first time I was listening to him on the phone, so I genuinely thought someone was taking the booking for me,\" he said.The Kremlin's airspace is supposed to be under heavy guard\n\nA dramatic statement from the Russian presidential administration claimed that Ukraine had used two drones to attack the Kremlin - at the heart of Moscow - overnight.\n\nRussian forces apparently used radar equipment to disable the drones. There were no casualties, and the president was unhurt, it said.\n\nBut the Kremlin did call it \"an assassination attempt\" against Vladimir Putin.\n\nA number of videos then surfaced. They appear to show at least one drone flying towards the Kremlin, followed by an explosion. Another appears to show smoke rising from a Kremlin structure, and a fire. The BBC has been unable to verify that it was a drone and it is unclear what really happened.\n\nBut if what the Kremlin is saying is true, and this was a genuine attempt on the president's life, then it would be a highly embarrassing incident for the Kremlin.\n\nBy all accounts, Mr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At his events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles, with airspace closed and traffic halted.\n\nQuestions will now be asked about how well-protected the Russian leader is - and about the effectiveness of Russian air defences.\n\nIn recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings, including the defence ministry. They have been placed there precisely for this reason - because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets.\n\nIf that's what this incident was, then those measures failed.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of attacks and explosions that have hit Russian territory in recent weeks and months.\n\nThe last few days have seen a spike in such incidents. On Wednesday morning, a fuel depot caught fire in Russia's Krasnodar Region, reportedly caused by a drone attack. Two freight trains were derailed in Bryansk Region, near the border with Ukraine, on Monday and Tuesday, in separate but identical incidents. The local governor said improvised explosive devices were to blame.\n\nOver the weekend, Russia-installed officials in occupied Crimea claimed Ukrainian drones were responsible for an attack on a fuel storage facility.\n\nThe frequency of such attacks is causing nervousness amongst ordinary Russians.\n\nRussian media report that police in Moscow have been inundated with calls from the public reporting drone sightings in the capital.\n\nUkraine has vehemently denied attacking the Kremlin or targeting President Putin. But whether the Russian account of what happened is accurate or not, the question now is whether Moscow will respond - and if so, how.\n\nSome Russian officials have already called for tough action. An assassination attempt against the president, if that's what this was, is an extremely serious matter. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to strikes on Russian territory.\n\nBut does Russia have the capacity to carry out any meaningful retaliatory strikes? It remains to be seen whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield.Nicola Foster (left) and Yvette Sampson bonded over their loss of their daughters\n\nIn 2018, two new mothers died of herpes - a common, normally mild infection - just weeks apart, shortly after giving birth by Caesarean section at the same NHS Trust.

Because we've both been in the same situation, we understand how the other's feeling.\"\n\nAt first glance, the two women are not natural companions. Their personalities are very different - Yvette, 54, is quiet and softly spoken while Nicola, 56, is louder and more forthright.\n\nBut their inner cores - an ironclad determination sustained by overwhelming grief - matters more than any superficial characteristics. \"We have helped each other. No-one else can understand it unless you've been through it,\" says Nicola.\n\nDespite not meeting until 2021, the two women have known of each other since the summer of 2018", "would be \"incredibly emotional for everyone involved with the BBC Singers, but also in choral music, because I think the last few weeks have shown how people look up to the BBC Singers\".\n\nNaomi Pohl, general secretary of the Musicians' Union, said: \"The outpouring of love for the BBC Singers and orchestras over the past few weeks has been incredible and we know our members are hugely grateful for all the support they've received.\"\n\nThe corporation's U-turn was received with relief by many in the arts world.\n\n\"This is wonderful news,\" tweeted actor Samuel West, who performed with the BBC Singers at the 2002 Proms. \"Thank you @BBC for listening to reason, and music, and beauty.\"\n\n\"Rejoice! What a fabulous way to start a Friday,\" added former MP Ed Balls. Opera star Jennifer Johnston said she was \"cautiously optimistic\", while conductor John Rutter thanked \"all who raised their voice\" in protest.\n\nThat included thousands of amateur singers in choirs across the UK and abroad, who joined forces to produce a video pleading for the BBC Singers to be saved.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

According to the latest BBC annual report, \u00a325m was spent on orchestras and performing groups in the last financial year.\n\nThe BBC says it needs to find \u00a3400m in savings by 2027 because of the two-year freeze in the licence fee imposed by the government.\n\nThe move caused consternation across the classical music world. Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber called the cuts \"lamentable\" and said they called the future of the licence fee into question.\n\n\"What has happened to our nation's beloved BBC - the organisation that has been responsible for some of the greatest classical music broadcasts in history?\" he said in the Radio Times.\n\nOn Thursday, the Telegraph reported that Britain's pre-eminent conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, \"may be willing to boycott the BBC Proms\" in protest at the cuts.\n\nThe Musicians' Union has said it would continue to fight to save roles in other BBC performing groups.\n\nThe BBC Singers, based at Maida Vale, perform across the UK and around the world, making annual appearances at the BBC Proms.\n\nThe BBC Concert Orchestra can be heard on BBC Radio 2's Sunday Night Is Music Night and on BBC Radio 3. It explores a wide selection of music, ranging from classical to contemporary.\n\nThe BBC Philharmonic is based at Media City UK in Salford, and performs an annual season of concerts at Manchester's Bridgewater Hall, as well as giving regular concerts at other venues across the north of England.\n\nThe BBC Symphony Orchestra plays a major role at The Proms, and also has an annual season at London's Barbican. Its commitment to contemporary music is demonstrated by a range of premieres each season.\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said it would \"continue to engage with the Musicians' Union and the other BBC Unions about our proposals on the BBC's English Orchestras\".\n\n\"The financial challenges are still there,\" said Mr Webb, \"but we've set out our plan\u2026 and now we're listening.\n\n\"If there are counter-proposals, we're very much listening to that, as we have done with the BBC Singers.\"Nicholas Whitehead says the sign started out as a \"wild conversation\"\n\nIt is the mid Wales landmark that started out as a joke and lasted for 20 years.\n\nNow, it is making a comeback.\n\nUp until last November, there was a billboard for Llandegley International on the A44 in Powys between Rhayader and Kington.\n\nBut drivers who followed the directions to Terminal 1 or 3 ended up not at an airport, not even an airfield, but just a field on the outskirts of the village.\n\nThe sign was taken down last year when the man who spent \u00a325,000 keeping it in place decided he would try to make it an official landmark.\n\nNicholas Whitehead launched a crowdfunding campaign with the slogan \"give us a sign\".\n\nSix months later, a brand-new one has appeared.\n\nThe airport's \"founder\" said he was delighted.\n\n\"When the sign came down we gained thousands of followers on Facebook. There was so much support for getting another, I felt sure the crowd-funder would work,\" he said.\n\nNicholas Whitehead launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund a new sign\n\n\"In a time of austerity, no local authority would want to pay for this, so we tried to raise all the money ourselves. We only needed \u00a31,300 and we raised \u00a32,000.\"\n\nThe extra money will be donated to the Wales Air Ambulance, which Mr Whitehead said he was happy to support given the aviation connection.\n\nMr Whitehead was a journalist and editor for the Brecon and Radnor Express, and a writer on Radio 4's comedy sketch show 'Week Ending'. He also worked on the satirical magazine 'Squib' with Monty Python's Terry Jones.\n\nWith a sense of the absurd and a desire to do \"something completely different\", he created the fictional airport in 2002.\n\n\"It started off as a wild conversation with friends one evening. We thought of renting a sign for something that wasn't really there, possibly a project that didn't exist, and we settled on the airport.\"\n\nHe soon realised the plan was possible.\n\n\"I approached Wrexham Signs, who own the billboard, and expected them to say, 'you can't do that'. But apparently, you can,\" he said.\n\n\"As a journalist, you find that whatever you do, someone, somewhere, is going to get upset about it. But Llandegley International is the exception. People love it.\"\n\nIn the sign's original location near Crossgates, it cost about \u00a31,500 per year to maintain.

The place is getting worse.\"\n\nThe message in February, which I received from a member of the maternity team, was stark but unsurprising. In a series of texts over the previous few months, the person had been getting increasingly concerned about what was happening at the East Kent trust.\n\nThe leadership is \"totally ineffective\" read one message. \"How long do we have to keep hearing this narrative - we accept bad things happened, we have learned and are putting it right. Nothing changes.\"\n\nFriday's report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is unfortunately just the latest marker in a near-decade of failure to improve maternity care at the trust. The revelation that inspectors considered closing the unit at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford comes nine years after the trust's head of midwifery made a similar recommendation for the same reasons - that it was a danger to women and babies. The failure to act decisively then allowed many poor practices to continue.\n\nAn independent review published last October found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies may have survived with better care, while 12 other babies and 23 mothers wouldn't have suffered harm if they'd received good maternity care.\n\nPut simply, the trust has repeatedly failed to provide good care - and then failed to act when presented with evidence of poor care.\n\nConsider the extraordinary deaths of two new mothers from herpes at two of the trust's hospitals, just six weeks apart in 2018. The trust told the families there was no connection between the deaths. There were. A BBC investigation three years later found they'd been operated on by the same surgeon, and that the trust had failed to test him for herpes despite being told to do so.\n\nWhen those disclosures led to an inquest being ordered, the trust delayed its start for weeks by making last-minute legal arguments about wanting the coroner to put reporting restrictions on naming the surgeon, arguments it could have made months earlier, as it had been repeatedly discussed at previous hearings.\n\nWhen the inquest took evidence, a consultant microbiologist at the trust, Dr Sam Moses, was reprimanded for allegedly coaching a colleague in how to respond to answers while another clinician was sitting in the witness box.\n\nDr Moses also admitted that he hadn't told one family about the connections between the deaths, despite being in a meeting in which the mother of one of the women who had died asked explicitly about a link. He told the court that \"my role was to assist the trust. I didn't know whose responsibility it was to tell\" about the connection.\n\nAt the heart of the trust's problems, it seems, is a dysfunctional culture that stretches back almost a decade. In 2015, a review of its maternity services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found multiple problems, including consultants failing to carry out ward rounds, assess women or attend out-of-hours calls. The report was dismissed as \"a load of rubbish\" by the trust. A Maternity Improvement Plan, overseen by NHS England, was devised. However, by the end of 2019 fewer than a quarter of its action points had been completed.\n\nImproving care is virtually impossible if colleagues don't get along. An Employment Tribunal decision, published in February, concluded that a \"toxic and difficult working environment\" existed at William Harvey Hospital's maternity unit where people were \"shouted and sworn at over differences of professional opinion\".\n\nOlukemi Akinmeji, a black midwife, sued the trust for race discrimination and victimisation after colleagues \"joked\" that they should \"check their bags\" on her last day at the hospital. Ms Akinmeji, who worked at the William Harvey between 2018 and 2020, won her case.\n\nThe tribunal judgement described hearing evidence of a broken working environment and a foul-mouthed registrar that one former colleague described as \"totally unprofessional\". Since Ms Akinmeji left the trust, that doctor has been promoted to consultant, after apparently being told to cut out the swearing.\n\nThree former staff have told the BBC there is a clique of senior midwives at the William Harvey, nicknamed by some as \"the untouchables\". They are described as \"watching each other's backs\", swearing, prone to talking disparagingly about both patients and colleagues. They've been working there for many years and are resistant to new working methods, and often, outsiders.\n\n\"It is the worst trust I've ever worked for,\" says one, \"there is so much unprofessional behaviour\". Another former staff member says,\"midwives often left the end of their shifts in tears, or broke down during a shift. People felt they couldn't speak up - even the managers had their favourites.\"\n\nIn that context, it's little wonder that the CQC found low morale and low levels of staff satisfaction, particularly among maternity staff at the William Harvey. Last year's staff survey, recently published, found that on all nine measures rated - including \"we are safe and healthy\" and \"we are always learning\" - the scores from all maternity staff were significantly lower than elsewhere in the trust. Bear in mind that the trust's overall scores included some of the lowest scores of any trust in England.\n\nIt's not as if East Kent has been left alone to sort its problems out. NHS England has been all over the trust for years, overseeing improvement plans and sending, as it announced in 2020, \"an expert team into the trust to ensure that improvements are made immediately\". Asked why their effort hadn't improved maternity care, NHS England couldn't provide an answer but said they had helped them recruit more nurses and midwives.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the East Kent trust said it accepted it \"was not consistently providing the standards of maternity care women and families should expect.\" But it says that in the past few years, it has \"worked hard to improve services,\" including investing \"to increase the number of midwifes and doctors\" and to improve staff training.\n\nOn the final day of evidence in the inquest into the two deaths from herpes, in a different room in the same building, a pre-inquest review was taking place into the death of a 14-day-old boy in September 2022 at the William Harvey Hospital. Evidence heard at that hearing suggests that with better care, his death may have been avoided. The full inquest later this year will come to a final conclusion.\n\nThe baby's death, the CQC report and its actions at the herpes inquest show that East Kent's problem are deep-rooted and ongoing, and that multiple changes of various directors over many years have led to little discernible improvement.Former England bowler Tim Bresnan used a racial slur towards Azeem Rafiq's sister, a hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire has been told.\n\nRafiq claimed Bresnan used the term towards his sister Amna during a media day at Headingley in 2014.\n\nBresnan, who is not taking part in the process, denies the allegation.\n\nThe claim was part of the evidence heard on the first day of the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also set out its cases against former England bowler Matthew Hoggard and ex-Yorkshire coach John Blain, who have both withdrawn from proceedings.\n\nThe ECB will state its cases against former Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale and ex-bowling coach Richard Pyrah, who will both not attend, on Thursday before moving on to former England captain Michael Vaughan, who is set to appear.\n\nRafiq briefly spoke to confirm witness statements regarding Hoggard, Bresnan and Blain but the panel said they had no need to ask him further questions.

Kirsten Dunst opens up about the Hollywood gender pay gap\n\nHollywood star Kirsten Dunst has said she grew up at a time when there was \"major pay disparity\" between herself and her male co-stars.\n\nShe said she was paid less than male co-stars, even though she had more box office success, with films such as Jumanji (1995) and Bring It On (2000).\n\n\"I was very young and it just felt like at the time, what do you do?\" she said.\n\n\"I was 17, I was still learning my taste in film. I didn't even think to ask,\" she added.\n\nDunst has previously referred to the pay gap between her and actor Tobey Maguire, who she starred alongside in Spider-Man in 2002, as \"very extreme\".\n\nAlex Garland, who directs Dunst in his latest film, Civil War, agreed it had been a major issue but \"nobody questioned it, male executives didn't question it, these were all inherited opinions. They weren't thought about.\"\n\nDunst plays a war photographer documenting the United States in the grip of conflict and falling apart.\n\nThe star says the dystopian movie is \"very much a warning\" about what can happen.\n\nThe film \"leaves people with so much to think about\" and \"is a very moving, realistic piece about journalists\", the actress adds.\n\nDunst, 41, says it is refreshing her character is the lead in an action film and not a \"damsel in distress\".\n\nShe drew inspiration for the role from the famed war correspondent, Marie Colvin.\n\nThe actress plays a war photographer in her new film, Civil War\n\nIn the film, US government forces are fighting the separatist \"Western Forces\" led by Texas and California.\n\nThe civil war of the film's title appears to have been sparked by the president, played by Nick Offerman, who has ripped up the constitution by serving a third term in office (no-one is allowed to serve as president more than twice).\n\nParallels have been drawn to current US politics and events such as the 6 January insurrection, when supporters of Donald Trump attacked the Capitol Building in Washington DC.\n\nBut Garland, who also wrote the film, says the themes are not just about the US.\n\n\"The film is set in America but really this film is about two things. It is about journalists and it's about polarisation. Populist politics and polarisation which lead to extremism and extremist thinking.\"\n\nGarland, who wrote 28 Days Later and Ex Machina, adds: \"That's happening in America but it's happening here in this country [the UK] and it's been happening here for a long time and it's happening across Europe, the Middle East, Asia. I could list the countries where that would be true.\"\n\nHe adds that journalism is \"under attack\" which he finds \"strange, scary and dangerous\".\n\n\"You get people saying 'Do not trust the BBC' and you will be in places where you would be attacked and criticised for saying the unbiased news reporting organisation that you belong to.\"\n\nThe director says he was trying to showcase \"old fashioned journalists\" who document what is happening, without bias or opinion and leave other people to interpret what they do.\n\nAlex Garland wrote and directed the film while Nick Offerman stars as the president\n\nThe film has garnered largely positive reviews, with The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarding it five stars.\n\n\"Civil War moves in ways you'd forgotten films of this scale could,\" he wrote, \"with compassion for its lead characters and a dark, prowling intellect, and yet a simultaneous total commitment to thrilling the audience at every single moment.\n\n\"Each leg of the journey toggles between pin-drop suspense and rivetingly frantic firefights, often staged with a mesmerisingly surreal edge.\"\n\nEmpire's John Nugent, giving it four stars, added: \"It never lets up, always gripping, always pummelling your senses, always ghoulishly compelling. Whatever your response to its political prevarication, this is undeniably confident, intense, sweaty-palmed filmmaking at the highest level.\"\n\nBut the Guardian's Adrian Horton was less keen, awarding it three stars overall. Civil War is \"decidedly anti-war but firmly unspecific\", she said, \"assiduously avoiding any direct correlation to current politics or, it turns out, any politics at all\".\n\n\"The distance,\" she concluded, \"makes for an at times frustrating watch - stimulating on the level of adrenaline, not emotions.\"\n\nDunst grew up in front of the camera, beginning her career when she was three years old.\n\nShe says pay disparity isn't the only issue when it comes to sexism in the movie industry.\n\nOne of Dunst's leading roles in her early 20s was in Sofia Coppola's 2006 Marie Antoinette biopic.\n\nShe played the titular role and says the movie \"was panned\" by film critics.\n\n\"The people that were watching that movie were my age, they weren't movie reviewers. Movie reviewers were old men. So to me, the people that enjoyed Marie Antoinette have now grown up and are like 'We loved this movie' but they weren't the people writing the reviews.\n\n\"We grew up in a world where it's man-kind, man-made, man this, man that, that's how we grew up.\"\n\nBut Dunst does think times have changed: \"Hopefully, the way I carve my path will help other actresses.\"\n\nCivil War is released in the UK, US and Canada on 12 April.The then Prince Charles meets fishmonger Pat O'Connell at the English Market in Cork in 2018\n\nAs King Charles III prepares to take to the throne he also takes on another legacy left over by his mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's 2011 trip to the Republic of Ireland is often seen as a turning point in Anglo-Irish relations.\n\nWill her son continue those steps in reconciliation and what has his relationship been with the Republic of Ireland?\n\nMarie Coleman, professor of 20th Century history at Queen's University Belfast, said that rather than building on his mother's legacy he is \"continuing his own legacy of building those good relations\".\n\n\"The Queen's visit didn't happen in isolation.

It was carrying people from sub-Saharan Africa, however where it departed from was unclear, a coast guard spokesperson told Reuters news agency.\n\nThose rescued include 80 men and six women, and with the assistance of a container ship, the boat was taken towards Gran Canaria island.\n\nMeanwhile, the search continues for the three missing vessels - the largest of which had an estimated 200 people on board, including many children.\n\nIt is thought to have left Senegal more than two weeks ago, on 27 June, heading for the Canary Islands, Walking Borders said.\n\nThe boat sailed from Kafountine, a coastal town that is roughly 1,700km (1,056 miles) from Tenerife.\n\nThe other two boats are slightly smaller and left four days earlier. One has about 65 people on board and the other up to 60.\n\nThis comes just weeks after an overcrowded trawler sank off the Greek coast, in one of the worst Mediterranean migrant shipwrecks.\n\nAt least 78 people were confirmed drowned, but the UN reported that up to 500 were still missing.\n\nThe voyage from West Africa to the Canary Islands is among the most dangerous routes for migrants. They usually sail in dugout fishing boats that are easily tossed by powerful Atlantic currents.\n\nLast year at least 559 people died at sea attempting to reach the Spanish islands, the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says. The death toll for 2021 was 1,126.\n\nHowever, the IOM says information about the number of departures from West Africa is scarce and shipwrecks are often not reported.\n\nIt adds that the migrants are often from Morocco, Mali, Senegal, Ivory Coast, or are of other sub-Saharan origins.\n\nAccording to Spain's interior ministry, 15,682 people arrived in the Canary Islands without permission in 2022, a drop of more than 30% compared with 2021.\n\n\"Despite the year-to-year decrease, flows along this dangerous route since 2020 remain high compared to prior years,\" the IOM says.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nGary Lineker will return to present Match of the Day after he was taken off air amid an impartiality row following his criticism of the government's new asylum policy.\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie said an independent review of BBC social media guidelines would be carried out - and denied the BBC had backed down.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"it was right\" the matter had been resolved.\n\nBut on Monday the BBC continued to face criticism from a range of sides.\n\nLineker said he supported the review and looked forward to getting back on air, describing the last few days as \"surreal\" and thanking people for their \"incredible support\".\n\nBut Tory backbench MP Philip Davies told the Mail Online the BBC's decision was a \"pathetic capitulation\" to Lineker and the \"start of the end for the licence fee\", while ex-cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg also warned the \"licence fee has passed its sell-by date\".\n\nLabour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, meanwhile, said the return of Lineker was welcome, but \"much bigger questions remain about the impartiality and independence of the BBC from government pressures\".\n\nFormer BBC director-general Greg Dyke compared the row to \"like a 5-0\" win for Lineker and said he thought there was a public perception the government had bullied the broadcaster into removing the TV star, which was \"very bad news\" for the BBC.\n\nEx-BBC News executive Sir Craig Oliver, who went on to be a Downing Street communications chief under then-Prime Minister David Cameron, described the situation as \"a total mess\" and said it was the \"wrong choice\" to have asked Lineker to step back in the first place.\n\n\"The reality is the BBC today has announced it will have a review of its social media guidelines,\" he told the BBC. \"In fact, it needs a review of how it handles crisis like these.\"\n\nSir Michael Lyons, a former BBC chairman under Labour, told BBC Newsnight: \"It simply isn't possible for the BBC to be a champion of dissent in Russia and Hong Kong, and at the same time not leave space for dissent in this country.\"\n\nHe added there was \"a big question about consistency in the way rules are applied\" saying some BBC stars have been allowed to say things about the Labour Party, referring to a tweet by Lord Alan Sugar advising people not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nFormer controller of BBC editorial policy Richard Ayre said rewriting guidelines was not straightforward and was \"going to be a nightmare\".\n\n\"Whatever emerges will be unsatisfactory to a significant number of people. It's inevitable.\"\n\nEarlier, Davie insisted the decision to pull Lineker off air was about buying some time until the two sides could come to an agreement over his political tweets - and said that was exactly what had happened.\n\nHe said he took \"proportionate action\", adding: \"We believe we did the right thing. I think I did the right thing.\"\n\nWhen challenged by BBC media correspondent David Sillito on whether it was a climbdown by the BBC, he said: \"I don't think so.\n\n\"I've always said, we needed to take proportionate action. For some people, by the way, we've taken too severe action... others think we're being too lenient.\"\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, Davie apologised, saying: \"Everyone recognises this has been a difficult period for staff, contributors, presenters and, most importantly, our audiences. I apologise for this.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: The weekend of BBC football show chaos... in 90 seconds\n\nThe row began last week when, in a tweet, Lineker said the government's new Illegal Migration Bill was an \"immeasurably cruel policy\" and said the language used around it was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".\n\nHis words were criticised by Conservative ministers, including the home secretary.\n\nLineker was told on Friday to step back from presenting Match of the Day until an agreement was reached. It triggered an unprecedented wave of walkouts from fellow pundits and commentators in solidarity with Lineker, which disrupted weekend football coverage across the BBC.\n\nSports presenter Mark Chapman - who did not present BBC Radio 5 Live's Saturday Coverage or Match of the Day 2 on Sunday on TV - returned to football radio", "\u2019.

Under trade union laws, life-and-limb cover must be provided.\n\nThe junior doctors' approach contrasts with recent strikes by nurses and ambulance workers, which saw unions agree to exempt certain emergency services.\n\nBut doctors say they are striking for patient safety as much as about pay, saying that current pay levels are affecting recruitment and leading to many doctors leaving the profession.\n\nDr Emma Runswick, deputy chairwoman of the BMA, said they are hoping this round of industrial action will be the last - but \"we will continue\" if the government does not move.\n\nShe told BBC One's Breakfast. \"This is not a situation where we are fixed in our position. We are looking for negotiations and Steve Barclay isn't even willing to talk to us.\n\n\"He hasn't put any offer at all on the table. If we want to start a negotiation there has to be two sides in the discussion.\"\n\nMr Barclay said he had hoped to begin formal pay negotiations with the BMA last month but said its demand for a 35% pay rise was unfair and would result in some junior doctors \"receiving a pay rise of over \u00a320,000\".\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike? Are you a patient affected? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it would be \"the most disruptive industrial action in NHS history\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme as the walkout began on Tuesday morning, Mr Powis warned it \"will take weeks\" to recover from the strikes as \"services will undoubtedly be affected\".\n\nDuring last month's three-day walkout by junior doctors, more than 175,000 treatments and appointments were cancelled.\n\nBut Prof Sir Stephen added the expectation is to see \"considerably more\" cancellations this time around due to the strike lasting four days. Estimates from other senior NHS figures have suggested between 250,000 and 350,000 appointments and operations could be cancelled.\n\nMental health services and some GP surgeries are also expected to be impacted, while the NHS said it will prioritise keeping critical care, maternity, neonatal care, and trauma operations running.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, co-chairman of the BMA junior doctors' committee, advised people to still ring 999 if they have a life-threatening illness as \"the service is working as normal and we have prioritised emergencies\".\n\nDr Paul Turnbull, 61, from Hampshire, who is an occupational health doctor, needs a prosthetic femur bone implanted in his leg.\n\nHis operation has been cancelled twice - once in December, because he developed deep vein thrombosis, and the second time because of the first junior doctors' strike. The operation is now due to take place on 18 April, after the four-day strike.\n\nHe has limited mobility and is unable to work.\n\n\"As a doctor, I don't believe doctors should strike. I think our first responsibility is to our patients and I think using patients as pawns in a dispute with the government is not something we should be doing.\"\n\nNeuroscientist Dr Camilla Hill, 42, from Nottingham, has also been affected. She has had two knee operations cancelled because of the junior doctors' strikes - one this week and one back in March. She now has a third date scheduled for 25 April.\n\nShe has been unable to do some of her favourite hobbies, which include hiking and sailing, in part because of", "carried out as part of a large-scale international investigation led by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) in Venice.\n\nOfficers worked with police forces across Europe to carry out dozens of raids and recover millions in assets.\n\nItaly's financial police says officers seized flats, villas, Rolex watches, Cartier jewellery, gold and cryptocurrencies during the raids.\n\nThey also seized luxury cars, including a Lamborghini Urus, a Porsche Panamera and an Audi Q8.\n\nLuxury watches were among the assets seized in Thursday's raids\n\nThe EPPO says a group of criminals set up fake companies in order to secure millions in grants from the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) for Italy.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, they filed fake corporate balance sheets to show that their businesses qualified for the funding.\n\nIn fact, the companies were \"only created to defraud the European taxpayer\", according to deputy European chief prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Ritter.\n\nThe alleged criminal organisation is suspected of using \"advanced technologies\" to aid its activities, including virtual private networks, foreign cloud servers and artificial intelligence software, an EPPO report says.\n\nWhen the suspects received the funds in Italy, they transferred them to bank accounts in Austria, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nA network of accountants, service providers and public notaries allegedly supported the suspects. One accountant has been barred from practising as a result of the investigation.\n\nItaly's financial police seized assets worth more than \u20ac600m (\u00a3514.4m) in raids across Europe on Thursday\n\nThe EU's RRF was set up in 2021 to disburse \u20ac723.8bn (\u00a3620.6bn) across the bloc after the Covid pandemic disrupted businesses worldwide. Italy is the largest single recipient of the fund.\n\nThe EPPO has 1,927 investigations in progress, involving suspected fraud worth \u20ac19.2bn (\u00a316.5bn), according to its 2023 annual report.\n\nBy the end of last year, some 206 of these investigations were into fraud relating to the EU's post-Covid funding projects.International summits are a curious mix of the theatrical, diplomatic and administrative.\n\nThey are a huge undertaking, with massive security.\n\nLittle wonder - a collection of world leaders, in the same place, at the same time, at a long-before advertised event.\n\nAnd so the skies swarm with helicopters and the streets swarm with lanyard-wearing attendees, clutching their all-important accreditation for fear that, without it, even crossing the road might prove impossible.\n\nI spotted two of my colleagues in the travelling British press pack out on a jog the other day, in the driving rain - shorts and T shirts on, yellow G7 lanyards still hanging around their necks.\n\nPity the poor residents of the host city suddenly unable to take their normal route to work or wherever, because of road closures.\n\nThen there is the theatre.\n\nAt the heart of politics are people. Personal relationships matter in politics and diplomacy just as they do in any other walk of life.\n\nAnd politicians, in particular, have audiences back home to address, images to burnish and impressions to leave.\n\nSo there are the theatrical moments, such as Rishi Sunak wearing the red socks - costing \u00a38 we were told - of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team, whose fans include the host of the summit, the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThis might seem trivial, and is a little theatrical - but it also has a value beyond the pictures.\n\nThe relationships international leaders have are so often very brief - one or the other leaves office, and along comes a successor - so acts that help establish and deepen those personal relationships have a real value.\n\nThen, there is the diplomacy.\n\nWinning friends and influencing people? The PM gets a selfie with other world leaders\n\nIn the weeks and months before a summit, diplomats for each country discuss their own outlooks and those of others, to try to find common ground.\n\nThese diplomats are known as \"sherpas\" - they lead the way to the summit\u2026\n\nTalking to those who have done just that for the UK, you get a sense of just how much work this is.\n\nThe subtleties, the nuances, the different emphases of different countries, on a huge range of issues - and changing all the time.\n\nThe political leaders then head to the summit.\n\nIn this instance, the PM had been in Iceland the day before setting off for Japan. He got back to Downing Street from Rekjavik at 2am.\n\nThe flight to Hiroshima, via Almaty in Kazakhstan, set off from Stansted in Essex at 9am.\n\nWe landed in Tokyo at 9am Japanese time the next day, 16 hours later, with a full day ahead.\n\nBy the end of the day we had made it to Hiroshima.\n\nWhen the political leaders come together there is a marathon series of talks, both in big groups, and in one-on-ones known as \"bilaterals\".\n\nAt the end, usually, emerges what is called a communique - the agreed conclusions.\n\nOften broad, often vague, they attempt to take account of every country's position, emphasis and focus on various issues, with the aim being that ongoing discussions can build upon them.\n\nAt this summit the communique came early, the day before the end.\n\nThere wasn't as much wrangling or even chaos that can occasionally happen.\n\nAnd then finally, a round of news conferences - an opening statement from leaders, followed by questions, often on a wide range of topics.\n\nI asked the PM about the big political story of the day - the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Times storyabout the home secretary's actions after being caught speeding last year.\n\nHe was clearly irritated to be immediately confronted by the conduct of one of his ministers after several long days of international diplomacy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nLittle wonder: sleep deprivation, jet lag, complex international deliberations - and then here come (entirely unsurprising) questions about a row back home.\n\nThe answer I was given amounted to a holding position: the PM and home secretary hadn't yet spoken about it.\n\nThere was no endorsement of Braverman - but no referral to the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests either.\n\nIncidentally, we already know Sunak's view on Braverman breaching the ministerial code before he was PM, because he reappointed her as home secretary after she had done just that and resigned.\n\nBut it is striking that Downing Street sources are letting it be known that the PM had no idea until the story broke last night about the home secretary's speeding offence, or her request for help from civil servants with its consequences.\n\nHe was, I'm told, not informed about it by the Cabinet Office or the Home Office.\n\nNo 10 is making it clear that the home secretary hadn't told him, and neither had the Whitehall machine, the civil service.\n\nIt is striking too that this story should come via two newspapers, not one, just days after a speech by Braverman that read rather like a future leadership bid.\n\nThe story also comes ahead of the publication of new net migration statistics on Thursday.\n\nNumbers are expected to reach a record high, a subject about which Braverman has articulated strong views both publicly and privately within government.\n\nIt doesn't appear the government's planned changes to student visas - in particular restrictions on those entitled to bring dependents - will be announced quite yet.\n\nAs for summits, there is a Nato one in Lithuania in the summer, and then the G20 in Delhi in September.\n\nWhat a moment that will be for the PM, and indeed his wife Akshata Murty, were she to choose to accompany her husband once again as she did to Hiroshima.\n\nShe was born and grew up in India. He is of Indian heritage himself.Nicola Sturgeon was synonymous with the SNP, but is now facing calls to quit the party she once led\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has rejected calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP after his predecessor was", "tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country,\" he told the broadcaster.\n\nIn his statement on Saturday Mr Trump called for mass protests from supporters and accused Mr Bragg's office of \"illegal leaks\" to journalists.\n\nAsked about the call for protests, Mr Pence said that US citizens have a \"constitutional right to peaceably assemble\" - but also said any action must take place \"peacefully and in a lawful manner\".\n\nSpeaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy called the investigation \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA\".\n\nIn a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".\n\nDemocrats accused Mr Trump of stirring up political divisions with his claims.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, Democratic Senator Elizbeth Warren said \"no-one is above the law\" even if they happen to have been president and any investigation must be \"allowed to go forward appropriately\".\n\n\"There's no reason to protest this. This is the law operating as it should without fear or favour for anyone,\" she said.\n\nMr McCarthy's predecessor as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ms Warren's sentiments - adding that Mr Trump's remarks were \"reckless\" and designed to \"keep himself in the news and to foment unrest among his supporters\".\n\n\"He cannot hide from his violations of the law, disrespect for our elections and incitements to violence. Rightfully, our legal system will decide how to hold him accountable,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Stormy Daniels case centres on how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after he paid Ms Daniels $130,000 before the 2016 US election.\n\nThe record for the payment reimbursing Mr Cohen says it was for \"legal fees\". Prosecutors could conclude this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, which is a misdemeanour offence in New York.Nationwide will become the latest lender to raise mortgage rates again, with increases of up to 0.7 percentage points taking effect on Friday.\n\nThe building society, one of the UK's biggest lenders, said that the changes were being made to ensure it could serve all its customers.\n\nAnother lender, Clydesdale Bank, said it was withdrawing deals via brokers later on Thursday owing to high demand.\n\nOne broker said the market was in a \"vicious circle\".\n\nAndrew Montlake, of Coreco, said that lenders were putting up rates at short-notice, then borrowers were grabbing deals, leaving lenders inundated and having to pull or raise rates again.\n\n\"It is massively hard to navigate for everyone, especially clients, who need to make quick decisions in these circumstances, whilst brokers are working round the clock to try to lock in to these rates,\" he said.\n\nNationwide is the latest major to repeat rate rises. On Friday, it will increase the rates on a variety of fixed-rate mortgages sold via brokers. Among them is a 0.7 percentage point hike in interest on new deals for existing customers moving home.\n\nA spokesperson for the building society said lenders' costs were rising, and competitors were also putting up rates.\n\n\"This ensures that, as a building society, we can continue lending to all types of borrowers. Despite the changes in rates, our full mortgage range continues to remain available,\" he said.\n\nData on wages and rising prices mean markets anticipate inflation and interest rates to stay higher for longer than previously expected.\n\nThis has led to government borrowing costs - which directly impact mortgage rates - rising to levels as high as last year's mini-budget.\n\nThe base rate, set by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and currently at 4.5%, will be reviewed next week and is widely expected to go up for the 13th time in a row.\n\n\"It is important that everyone does not panic, and that includes the Bank of England,\" Mr Montlake said.\n\n\"Questions need to be asked as to whether they really do need to increase rates beyond 5% before previous rate changes have had an effect, and they risk causing more problems than they are trying to solve.\"Yevgeny Prigozhin may have boasted he had the loyalty of all 25,000 members of his mercenary army, but it seems that may have shifted as quickly as the Wagner Group's rebellion petered out.\n\nIn online messages analysed by BBC Verify, Wagner troops and their relatives raged against Prigozhin's decision to halt his dramatic march on Moscow and withdraw from the captured city of Rostov.\n\n\"The bald waste of space destroyed Wagner PMC with his own hands. And screwed everyone he could,\" fumed one online poster claiming to be a Wagner fighter on a Telegram channel with 200,000 followers.\n\n\"It's been another senseless revolt,\" they added.\n\nTelegram is the social media platform of choice for Wagner soldiers and pro-war circles in Russia, allowing often anonymous communication with thousands of followers at a time.\n\nIt was where Prigozhin chose to announce his so-called \"March of Justice\" against the Russian regime, but it has now become the place where many have turned against him.\n\nMark Krutov, a journalist with the RFE/RL outlet's Russian Service, has access to the Telegram group chats used by relatives of Wagner fighters. He shared some of their messages with the BBC.\n\n\"They were simply betrayed,\" one woman wrote. \"I trusted Prigozhin, but what he did is dishonourable.\"\n\n\"He shouldn't have done this. This is pure betrayal,\" agreed another user.\n\nPrigozhin long enjoyed highly vocal support from a network of pro-Wagner influencers. For months, they have championed his actions and attacked his opponents in the Ministry of Defence - particularly his sworn enemy, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nBut when the Wagner mutiny was developing, their reaction was surprisingly muted.\n\nTwo of the largest groups, Grey Zone and Reverse Side of the Medal - with almost 900,000 followers between them - did not rush to endorse his actions, instead aiming for the reasonably neutral middle ground of blaming antagonism by Mr Shoigu and his loyalists for the bloodshed.\n\nFighters of Wagner group stand guard outside the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don, Russia\n\nWagner PMC Briefs is a channel Prigozhin has confirmed as an official page of Wagner and is run by one of his troops. It noted - with eyebrows raised - that when Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the mutiny, he didn't mention anyone by name.\n\n\"[Putin] did not name \"the mutineers and traitors,\" it said. \"Perhaps it was to let Prigozhin restore justice and punish those guilty of real betrayal that resulted in the failure [of Russia's invasion of Ukraine]?\n\nThe theory that Mr Putin and Prigozhin conspired to stage a coup attempt in order to \"test the loyalty of the Russian elites\" quickly gained traction on social media.\"Girls, I thought maybe it was all orchestrated to remove Shoigu, but through Prigozhin, so Putin wouldn't have to do it himself?\" wrote a woman on the Wagner relatives' chat.\n\nVolodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta Center for Applied Political Research in Kyiv, disagrees.\n\n\"If it was staged, what for? So everyone could see how weak Putin is?\" he said. \"What happened was a public humiliation of Putin. And Prigozhin? He partially lost his reputation: He used to demonstrate power, and then he simply retreated.\"\n\nBut Prigozhin's last public comment on the day of the mutiny, filmed after he agreed to stand down, continues to fuel speculation online. \"We've had an OK result today,\" he said. \"Cheered everybody up.\"Lidl's new mince vac packs will be in stores from early next year\n\nLidl is the latest supermarket to announce it will start vac-packing mince to use less plastic and double its shelf life.\n\nSainsbury's hit the headlines when it made the same switch, and some shoppers complained it turned the meat to mush.\n\nAn anti-plastic group criticised the move from hard plastic trays to soft film, saying this would not go in most household recycling collections.\n\nLidl said its new vac packs could be", "ralisation of economic power to the nations and regions of the UK; and improved intergovernmental working between the various administrations of these islands.\n\n\"Decisions should be made by people most closely affected by those decisions,\" says Sir Keir.\n\nIsn't that an argument for independence?\n\nNo, he insists, it's an argument for local decision-making within the UK framework.\n\n\"The people in the Highlands can make decisions in partnership with the Labour government about the future living standards here, the future jobs, the skills we're talking about this morning,\" he explains.\n\nAware of this looming Labour threat, the SNP is keen to conflate Sir Keir's party with Rishi Sunak's, reminding voters that Labour and Tories joined together in the Better Together campaign against independence in 2014.\n\nLabour politicians joined Conservative and Liberal Democrat counterparts to campaign for the union ahead of the 2014 referendum\n\nSir Keir's decision to approvingly quote Margaret Thatcher in a speech on crime while in Stoke this week makes the SNP's job easier while underlining the Labour leader's difficulty in assembling such a diverse electoral coalition.\n\nStill, he can take comfort that his opponents here also face immense challenges.\n\nThe new SNP leader will have to tackle deep-rooted problems in Scotland's public services which are costing and blighting lives.\n\nHe or she will also be under pressure to set out a credible route map towards \u2014 and a credible plan for \u2014 independence.\n\nAnd the winner must also reunite a divided party in time for a general election expected to be held next year in which, it is now clearer than ever, Scotland will be a key battleground.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch the moment a man walks his daughter down the aisle after recovering from a serious brain injury\n\nFarmer Roger Jones was able to walk his daughter down the aisle two years after doctors warned his family he might not survive a brain infection.\n\nSurgeons had to remove part of his skull in 2021, leaving it unlikely the 68-year-old would ever return to the family farm in Castleton, Cardiff.\n\n\"They told us people in Roger's condition end up in long-term care,\" said wife Gill.\n\nBut determination to be there for his daughter helped him walk again.\n\n\"They actually told [my wife] they didn't think I'd live,\" Roger said, remembering how his illness began over Christmas in 2020 when one side of his face started to droop.\n\n\"We thought he'd had a stroke,\" Gill said, but doctors diagnosed a possible bout of shingles.\n\nThen in January 2021 he was diagnosed with a sinus infection that had breached Roger's brain membrane causing an abscess.\n\n\"At that point they weren't sure whether or not he would survive,\" Gill remembered, explaining how because of Covid restrictions she did not see her husband in person for nearly three months after first taking him to hospital.\n\nGill seeing Roger in person for first time in three months in April 2021 and (right) the couple's first night in their own bed, 633 days after he first went into hospital\n\nRoger underwent nine surgeries over a five-month period with surgeons first removing the infected parts of his skull and finally replacing the bone with a titanium plate.\n\n\"It was awful,\" Roger said, admitting he does not remember much from that period, besides worrying about the fate of his farm close to the M4.\n\nBut Gill and his daughter Kate had \"stepped up\" managing the cattle and sheep and preparing to plant crops while Roger sat alone in hospital.\n\nRoger was still unable to walk or stand up nearly five months after coming home from hospital\n\n\"We could not buckle,\" Gill said, \"because if we buckled he wouldn't have anything to come home to\".\n\nRoger began specialist physiotherapy at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital in June and came home in November.\n\nUnable to walk or even lift himself up, he had to depend on a team of in-home carers and a hoist to get around.\n\nRoger Jones had to have part of his skull removed to get rid of an infection\n\n\"When we had the discharge meetings, it was a case of 'this is as good as it gets',\" Gill said.\n\n\"They said, 'you might improve a bit more but... people with Roger's needs go to a care home'.\"\n\n\"I knew I wasn't going to do that, I was gonna fight. I had to fight it,\" Roger remembered thinking.\n\nDesperate to get back on the farm he had worked for more than 40 years daughter Kate Jones (left) strapped her dad to a golf buggy and drove him around\n\n\"We knew that we wanted to get him home,\" Gill said.\n\nRoger said being at home \"made all the difference\".\n\nHe set a goal of driving a tractor again, something he had not done yet, and when his daughter Jessie got engaged, of being able to walk her down the aisle.\n\n\"It's something you do really,\" he said, \"you want to take them down the aisle\".\n\nHe said the first \"game changer\" was getting a mobility scooter to help around the house.\n\nRoger taking his first steps in April 2022 with physiotherapist Jakko Brouwers\n\nBut when it came to walking, Roger was afraid of falling down and not being able to get up.\n\nJakko Brouwers, a physiotherapist from the Morrello clinic in Newport, started to make home visits to Roger in April 2022. Gill remembers him saying \"this man will walk again\".\n\nBut the first step was telling him to get on the floor, she said.\n\n\"Then he said, 'right, now crawl over to the chair pull yourself up' and he said 'now if you fall over you can get up'.\"\n\nBy February this year, after months at home, he was talking his first steps with a walking stick.\n\nRoger and his daughter Jessie Wheatley practising for their walk down the aisle\n\n\"It's his farming gut determination and strength,\" Gill said, \"that has put him where he is here because if he didn't have that he could have just said 'you know what, this is too much'.'\n\nIn June, his daughter Jessie Wheatley, 37, who was living in Queensland, Australia, came home to prepare for her wedding at a chapel near the farm.\n\nWalking every day with her dad was a big part of the preparations.\n\nDuring these walks, Jessie told her father how surprised she was at the progress he had made in a year.\n\nRoger replied: \"You've got to keep fighting haven't you?\"\n\nRoger achieved his goal of walking his daughter Jessie down the aisle\n\nRoger also got to dance with the new brideIn February this boat of migrants was rescued some 31 miles (50km) from Tunisia's coast\n\nAt least 29 migrants have died after at least two boats sank off Tunisia's coast within hours of each other, officials say.\n\nThe sub-Saharan migrants were trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Italy.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of migrant boat capsizes off Tunisia's coast in the last few days, with five others sinking in the past four days.\n\nThis comes after Tunisia launched a campaign against undocumented African migrants.\n\nMeanwhile, Italian officials on the island of Lampedusa say they are overwhelmed, after a record 2,500 migrants arrived in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Italian far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warned Europe risks seeing a huge wave of refugees arriving on its shores.\n\nTunisia has become a hub for migrants who wish to make it to Europe, with UN figures showing at least 12,000 migrants who landed on Italy's shores this year left from Tunisia. That figure was just 1,300 in the same time period last year.\n\nHowever, the Tunisia coast guard say they are taking steps to stop the migrant crossings, having halted around 80 vessels headed for Europe in the past four days, according to the Reuters news agency. It also says it has detained more than 3,000 migrants, the same agency reports.\n\nIn a controversial speech last", "Please enable Javascript or try a different browser.

Now there are four, some of them falling on the day of major sport and music events.\n\nAny hopes the RMT's dispute with 14 train companies was close to being solved, have now been dashed. It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

He denies wrongdoing.\n\nExtra security measures are in place with the authorities expecting protests outside the Manhattan court on Tuesday.\n\nMr Trump, 76, is the first ex-US president to face a criminal case.\n\n\"WITCH HUNT,\" the Republican wrote on his Truth Social platform shortly before travelling from his home in Florida to New York on Monday - a journey which drew blanket coverage across the US news channels.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, dozens of police and court officers, as well as Secret Service agents, are expected to escort Mr Trump through the streets of New York to the Lower Manhattan court complex.\n\nThe charges he faces will be disclosed in full at the hearing, which is scheduled for about 14:15 local time (19:15 BST). His lawyers have already said he will plead not guilty.\n\nThe former president is expected first to surrender at the office of Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nOnce Mr Trump is fingerprinted and processed by officials, he is considered under arrest and in custody. He will then be arraigned in court - meaning the charges will be read out and he will plead.\n\nMr Trump has been under investigation over a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) wire transfer by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHush money agreements are not illegal, but the Manhattan prosecutor has been investigating whether business records", "320km (200 miles) south of Moscow has attracted international attention because of the authorities' decision to remove his daughter from their home early in March.\n\n\"I'm in shock,\" Yefremov town councillor Olga Podolskaya said. \"A prison sentence for expressing your opinion is a terrible thing. A two-year jail term is a nightmare.\"\n\n\"When I heard that Alexei had gone on the run, that was the second shock. We hope that Alexei is OK and that nothing has happened to him.\"\n\nThe family's problems began last April, she told the BBC, when Masha Moskaleva's school told the police that the girl had drawn a Ukrainian flag with the words \"Glory to Ukraine\", rockets and a Russian flag bearing the phrase \"No to war!\"\n\nAlexei Moskalev had contacted Ms Podolskaya last year to tell her about the pressure he and his daughter were coming under. Masha's mother does not live in the area and is estranged from the family.\n\nMoskalev was initially fined for a comment about the war made on a social media network last year. But after his flat was searched in December he was charged under the criminal code because he had already been convicted of a similar offence.\n\nHe has been recognised as a political prisoner by human rights group Memorial, which has itself been banned by Russia's authorities.\n\nMoskalev was not allowed to communicate with the BBC during a visit to his building earlier this month. However, his lawyer said Moskalev was very worried that his daughter was not with him.\n\nAlexei Moskalev was being held under house arrest ahead of the verdict in Yefremov\n\nSocial services in Yefremov have officially been tasked with looking after the girl. The local Juvenile Affairs Commission had already taken legal action to restrict her father's parental rights. Last week he wasn't allowed to leave his house arrest to attend a preliminary hearing.\n\nAhead of the verdict on Tuesday Vladimir Biliyenko visited the children's home where Masha has spent most of the month.\n\nThe director told him that the girl had gone to a children's cooking festival and passed on two drawings she said Masha had done for her father, as well as a letter she had written him. Mr Biliyenko told Sotavision that Masha had written the words: \"Papa you're my hero.\"\n\nHe later spread the drawings on a table in court.\n\nAlthough Moskalev had turned up the day before, court press secretary Olga Dyachuk said he had escaped house arrest overnight and should have been taken into custody after the verdict.\n\n\"To say I'm surprised would be an understatement,\" Mr Biliyenko told the BBC. \"I've never seen anything like it. No client of mine has ever gone missing like this.

Friends, colleagues, old teammates as well as customers and their dogs\".\n\n\"We've been inundated with nice words and if we noticed it we spoke to him about it,\" she added.\n\n\"Assume he was aware of your kind words and very happy to hear them.\n\n\"He passed in the early hours of the morning surrounded by family.

It owns major cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Pall Mall.\n\nIn a statement, BAT said it had entered into a \"deferred prosecution agreement with DOJ and a civil settlement agreement with OFAC, and an indirect BAT subsidiary in Singapore has entered into a plea agreement with DOJ\".\n\nThe DOJ said BAT had also conspired to defraud financial institutions in order to get them to process transactions on behalf of North Korean entities.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is known to be a heavy smoker. Last year the US attempted to get the UN Security Council to ban tobacco exports to North Korea, but this was vetoed by Russia and China.\n\nAt a briefing on Tuesday, the DOJ's assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said the settlement was the \"culmination of a long-running investigation\", describing it as \"the single largest North Korean sanctions penalty in the history of the Department of Justice\".\n\nHe said that BAT was engaged in an \"elaborate scheme to circumvent US sanctions and sell tobacco products to North Korea\" via subsidiaries.\n\n\"Between 2007 and 2017 these third-party companies sold tobacco products to North Korea and received approximately $428m.\"\n\nCriminal charges were also revealed against North Korean banker Sim Hyon-Sop, 39, and Chinese facilitators Qin Guoming, 60, and Han Linlin, 41, for facilitating sales of tobacco to North Korea.\n\nA $5m (\u00a34.4m) bounty was put for any information leading to the arrest or conviction of Mr Sim, and $500,000 (\u00a3402,905) rewards for each of the other two suspects.\n\nThey were accused of buying leaf tobacco for North Korean state-owned cigarette makers and falsifying documents to trick US banks into processing transactions worth $74m. North Korean manufacturers including one owned by the military made about $700m thanks to these deals.\n\nPyongyang has for years faced multiple rounds of tough sanctions in response to its ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests.\n\nHowever that has not deterred Mr Kim from continuing to develop the country's weapons programme.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.HMS Glasgow was floated on the Clyde for the first time in December\n\nAn inquiry has been launched into \"intentional damage\" of a Royal Navy warship at a Scottish shipyard.\n\nDefence contractor BAE Systems said repairs were being assessed after about 60 cables were cut on HMS Glasgow.\n\nThe Type 26 frigate is currently being fitted out at BAE's yard at Scotstoun on the River", ", Manchester City 4.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory.\n\n\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nShe has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed.\n\nSide by side, the natural and synthetic mouse embryos looked very similar after eight days\n\nThe synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.\n\nProf Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos.\n\n\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\"\n\nMost countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.\n\nHowever, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.\n\nDr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\"\n\nLegal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.\n\nResearchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.\n\nProf Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.\n\n\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\"Hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered in Warsaw for one of Poland's largest demonstrations since the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nMost opposition parties have called on supporters to join the march against the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\n\nAmong those attending are former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and former President Lech Walesa.\n\nThe PiS has condemned the gathering as a \"march of hate\".\n\nThe mayor's office for Warsaw has estimated half a million people attended the event, which fell on the 34th anniversary of Poland's first partially-free elections.\n\nMany travelled from across the country to take part, and simultaneous demonstrations have been held in other Polish cities like Krakow.\n\nA wide variety of issues brought protests together, including frustrations over inflation, costs of living, and rights for women and LGBT.\n\nConcerns have also been raised against new law accused of undermining Poland's democracy.\n\nThe law, criticised by the EU and US, sets up a commission to investigate undue Russian influence in Polish politics, and has the power to ban people from assuming public office for 10 years.\n\nThe government denies it is subverting democracy and President Andrzej Duda has proposed amendments to remove these powers.\n\nBut critics say it could still be used against people, including Mr Tusk - Poland's main opposition leader and head of the centrist Civic Platform (PO) party.\n\nOpponents say it could also bolster the PiS' standing in this year's parliamentary elections.\n\nThe protest was attended by former President Lech Walesa (left) and former Prime Minister Donald Tusk (right)\n\nCrowds of people have been pictured waving Polish and EU flags and holding placards, and participants told the BBC that protesters were chanting \"democracy\" and \"we will win\".\n\n\"I came here to defend democracy because I can't stand how our parliament, the constitutional tribunal are destroyed, the European Union is diminished,\" one protester told Reuters news agency.\n\nDonald Tusk, a former head of the European Council, also welcomed supporters during the \"record\" march.\n\n\"Democracy dies in silence but you've raised your voice for democracy today, silence is over, we will shout,\" said Mr Tusk.\n\nAhead of the event, the PiS accused organisers of of hypocrisy, tweeting a video about police brutality and violence against the media while Mr Tusk was in office.\n\nWojciech Przybylski, editor of Visegrad Insight, told the BBC that these protests show Poland's opposition groups can unite over common causes, despite their political differences.\n\nBut PiS is still ahead in opinion polls, he adds, and \"this is going to mobilise them, because they know the opposition is for real\".Vivienne Groom says she feels she has been \"penalised\" for caring for her elderly mum\n\nA woman has told of her shock after the government seized \u00a316,000 left to her by her mother because she was overpaid her carer's allowance.\n\nVivienne Groom was prosecuted for failing to declare her minimum wage Co-op job while also caring for her mum.\n\nMrs Groom said she was told by a social worker she did not have to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the job.\n\nThe DWP said it was \"right\" it sought to claim back \"taxpayers' money\".\n\nAfter taking the job at the store in Tarvin, near Chester, Mrs Groom was told she had to pay back \u00a316,800.\n\nShe said she initially agreed a payment plan with the DWP at \u00a330 per month to cover the overpayments, which she received between 2014 and 2019.\n\nHowever, when the government discovered she stood to inherit \u00a316,000 following the death of her mum, it decided to seize it.\n\nMrs Groom told the BBC she was devastated by what had happened.\n\n\"I followed that lady's rules and I looked after my mum,\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, if people look after their parents they should be paid more money so they don't have to go to work as well.\n\n\"I had to go to work. We had bills to pay.\"\n\nThe only way for the DWP", "ens of military acronyms, the documents, some marked \"top secret\", paint a detailed picture of the war in Ukraine and also offer information on China and allies.\n\nPentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real.\n\nBBC News and other news organisations have reviewed the documents and these are some of the key findings.\n\nThe US believed the UN secretary general's stance on a key grain deal was undermining attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.\n\nAntonio Guterres was too willing to accommodate Russian interests, according to files which suggest Washington has been closely monitoring him.\n\nSeveral documents describe private communications involving Mr Guterres and his deputy.\n\nOne leaked document focuses on the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July following fears of a global food crisis.\n\nIt suggests that Mr Guterres was so keen to preserve the deal that he was willing to give in to Russia's demands - a stance which was \"undermining broader efforts to hold Russia accountable\".\n\nWhile the bulk of the leaked documents concern, in one way or another, the war in Ukraine, there are others that touch on a huge range of unrelated issues. Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations.\n\nLike the spread and purpose of Chinese technology.\n\nThe documents appear to have been printed out and folded before being photographed and posted online\n\nThree documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans.\n\nJordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out.\n\nNor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealed\n\nAnother document marked top secret addresses China's \"developing cyber-attack capabilities.\" It says these are designed \"to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain.\"\n\nNewly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties.\n\nThe main intelligence agency, the FSB, has \"accused\" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show.\n\nThese findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military.\n\nOne document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1).\n\nWestern governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.\n\nOther documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies.\n\nOne map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in \"modest territorial gains\".\n\nUkraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

One slide refers to as many as 223,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, and as many as 131,000 Ukrainians.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials have dismissed the leaks, suggesting they might constitute a Russian disinformation campaign. But there are signs of frustration and anger too.\n\nOne presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted: \"We need less contemplation on 'leaks' and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war.\"\n\nPresident al-Sisi is said to have told officials to keep production of rockets for Russia secret - but an Egyptian official says the allegation is baseless\n\nThe Washington Post obtained access to another document from mid-February, where they found that Egypt had plans to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia in secret.\n\nThe Post said President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi told officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West\".\n\nAn official is quoted as saying he would \"order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier\".\n\nIt is unclear what the earlier help refers to. In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation.\n\nThere is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia.\n\nAn unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as \"utterly baseless\" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war.\n\nThe Kremlin called it \"just another canard\" and the White House said there was \"no indication\" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Expert: US and Egypt ready to move forward after leak\n\nA classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine.\n\nThe report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers.\n\nThey are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war.\n\nOne of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US.\n\nAs part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia.\n\nThe leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation.\n\nThe Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February.\n\nThe missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents.Dmitry Mishov: \"I am an officer, not an accomplice in a crime\"\n\nA military defector who fled Russia on foot has given a rare interview to the BBC, in which he paints a picture of an army suffering heavy losses and experiencing low morale.\n\nLieutenant Dmitry Mishov, a 26-year-old airman, handed himself into the Lithuanian authorities, seeking political asylum.\n\nDmitry said escaping from Russia in such dramatic fashion, with a small rucksack on his back, was his last resort.\n\nHe is among a small handful of known cases of serving military officers fleeing the country to avoid being sent to Ukraine to fight - and the only case of a serving airman that the BBC knows of.\n\nDmitry, an attack helicopter navigator, was based in the Pskov region, in north-western Russia. When the aircraft started to be prepared for combat, Dmitry sensed a real war was coming, not just drills.\n\nHe tried to leave the air force in January 2022 but his paperwork had not gone through by the time Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. He was sent to Belarus where he flew helicopters delivering military cargo.\n\nDmitry says he never went to Ukraine. We cannot verify this part of his story but his documents appear to be genuine and many of his statements match what we know from other sources.\n\nIn April 2022 he returned to his base in Russia where he hoped to continue his decommissioning. It was a lengthy process which was close to completion - but in September 2022 President Putin announced partial military mobilisation. He was told he would not be allowed to leave the army.\n\nHe knew that sooner or later he would be sent to Ukraine and started looking for ways to avoid it.\n\n\"I am a", "Inflation is likely to remain high because of his preference for low interest rates.\n\nInternationally, he could continue to resist Sweden's bid to join Nato and will paint himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu and his allies want to remove the president's right to veto legislation, cutting the post's ties to political parties and making it electable every seven years.\n\nHe wants to bring inflation down to 10% and send 3.5 million Syrian refugees home. President Erdogan has promised to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu also wants kickstart Turkey's decades-long bid to join the European Union and restore \"mutual trust\" with the US, after years of fractious relations during the Erdogan years.The club said no current directors or senior managers were involved in price fixing\n\nLeicester City faces a fine of up to \u00a3880,000 for colluding to fix the price of replica football kits, the UK's competition regulator has said.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the club and retailer JD Sports had admitted to anti-competitive behaviour, including \"price fixing conduct\".\n\nIt said both broke competition law between 2018 and 2021 with an illegal deal on clothing sales.\n\nThe club has accepted the CMA findings.\n\nThe 2015-16 Premier League champions, and their parent companies, have subsequently agreed to pay a fine up to the maximum penalty of \u00a3880,000, the CMA said.\n\nJD Sports will avoid a fine after reporting the illegal activity.\n\nJD Sports said it signed a leniency agreement with the CMA last month\n\nThe provisional findings of a CMA investigation revealed that, in August 2018, JD Sports said it would stop selling Leicester City-branded clothing online for the 2018-19 season, and in January 2019, JD Sports agreed it would \"not undercut\" the club in terms of online sales for the following season by making Leicester City items exempt from free delivery.\n\nIt said JD Sports continued the agreement to sell all Leicester City clothing with the delivery charge until at least January 2021.\n\nMichael Grenfell, the CMA's executive director of enforcement, said: \"Strong and unimpeded competition between retailers is essential to consumers' ability to shop around for the best deals.\n\n\"Football fans are well-known for their loyalty towards their teams.\n\n\"In this case we have provisionally found that Leicester City FC and JD Sports colluded to share out markets and fix prices with the result that fans may have ended up paying more than they would otherwise have done.\n\n\"Both parties have now admitted their involvement, allowing us to bring the investigation to a swift conclusion.\n\n\"The fine that Leicester City FC and its parent companies have agreed to pay sends a clear message to them and other businesses that anti-competitive collusion will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe club, which was relegated to the Championship last season, stressed none of its current directors or senior management were involved in the arrangements.\n\n\"These arrangements related to a limited number of bulk orders by JD Sports, which were accepted by the club's retail sales team over the relevant period,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"There was no intention on the part of the club to unlawfully restrict the resale of the goods supplied and no material financial advantage to be gained from doing so, given the limited amount of kit supplied to JD Sports.\n\n\"However, the club accepts the CMA's findings and has taken steps to strengthen its training and compliance measures to ensure the club's retail operations fully comply with competition law.\"\n\nJD Sports also said no current or former directors or senior management of JD were involved in the offending conduct and that it signed a leniency agreement with the CMA last month.\n\nThe company added: \"JD has taken a number of steps to strengthen its competition compliance programme and the board reaffirms its commitment to making the necessary resource available, internal and external, to ensure that this is embedded into its daily operations.\"\n\nThe announcement come almost a year after JD Sports, its rival Elite Sports and Rangers Football Club were handed fines over price fixing on replica kits.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Then they are telling us security was not enough to cope with the numbers.\n\n\"We're just obviously disappointed. It's four o'clock and we are nowhere near there [the front] yet.\"\n\nPlay began at 11:00 BST, but just before midday organisers advised people not to travel to join the queue.\n\nThe queue has become a Wimbledon tradition, with 500 tickets available for each of the main three courts - Centre Court, Court One and Court Two - with the remaining fans able to buy ground passes to watch the outside courts.\n\nLast year the queue", ".\n\nOne man advertising on Facebook claimed he could provide a UK driving licence for \u00a3720, with the pass certificate delivered to the reporter's home in five days - without anyone actually sitting a test.\n\nA theory test costs \u00a323 and the practical test \u00a362, but the RAC estimates the total cost of learning to drive is \u00a31,551 including tests and lessons - assuming the person passes first time. In Northern Ireland the tests cost \u00a323 for the theory and \u00a345.50 for the practical test.\n\nOne woman who advertised on Facebook in Vietnamese told our reporter she charged \u00a31,600 for help with cheating the theory test and \u00a32,600 for the practical driving test - a total of \u00a34,200.\n\nShe said first she needed to see what the reporter looked like to ensure she had a suitable lookalike to take the tests.\n\nThe BBC also tracked down a woman who paid for a fraudulent service. She had found someone via a Facebook post to take the practical test for her son who had been struggling to pass.\n\nThe mother paid the fraudster about \u00a31,000 after he had passed the test on her son's behalf.\n\nIf the woman's son is ever caught he would have his licence revoked and face prosecution for fraud, potentially resulting in a prison sentence and/or a fine.\n\nTikTok and Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC that the solicitation of driving licence fraud is not allowed on their platforms and any content found that violates their guidelines will be removed.\n\nTikTok also says it has taken action against a number of accounts following the BBC Investigation.\n\nDriving instructors have told the BBC that the rise in practical test fraud could be due to the length of time it is taking to get a practical test slot.\n\nIn some parts of the UK there are waiting times of up to six months due to a backlog following the Covid pandemic. Some of the fraudsters the BBC spoke to were willing to travel to parts of the UK where waiting times are shorter to take the test for others.\n\nCarly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, said the backlog was causing \"a desperation for test slots\".\n\n\"If you're facing the fact that if you don't pass the test you have to wait for up to six months [to try again], then you're going to think about cheating the system,\" she said.\n\nShe added that some of the instructors in her association had been approached by people running criminal services, asking them to refer pupils struggling to pass their test.\n\nThe high demand for tests has led to operators bulk-buying slots using automated software and reselling them at an inflated price.\n\nThe DVSA says it is actively removing accounts which do this as it breaks the terms and conditions of the booking platform.\n\nThe man, who called himself Erdal, told the reporter he could feed them the answers to the theory test via a Bluetooth earpiece\n\nDuring the investigation, the BBC found a flyer in a London cafe written in Turkish offering a \"100% guarantee\" method to pass the theory test.\n\nOur undercover reporter, posing as someone with little experience of driving, met the man behind the advert, who called himself Erdal.\n\nHe told the reporter he could help them cheat by feeding them the answers to the test's multiple choice questions using a \"microscopic\" Bluetooth earpiece, connected to a mobile phone.\n\nHe told them by clicking on the questions they would be \"read out loud\" by the computer which would allow him to whisper the correct answers.\n\nHe said: \"It's \u00a31,500 and you will pay me right after taking the test. You will be wearing a device in your ear. The test administrators will not look in your ear.\n\n\"We have done this for a long time. We do this for a minimum of two people every day.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, the BBC called the number we had for the man to confront him about the scam. The person that answered had the same name but denied knowing anything about test fraud.\n\nThese scam online adverts can also cause identity fraud problems for the people who have photos of their test pass certificates or driving licence lifted from legitimate sites.\n\nWe spoke to Ian Jones, who had a photo of his driving licence stolen from a logistics company he was registered with. He later discovered it was being used on Instagram by someone advertising a service for \"theory/practical certificate without exams\".\n\nMr Jones says in the past year he has had to dispute hundreds of French speeding and parking tickets he has received because his licence details are being used fraudulently abroad.\n\nHe said: \"It makes you paranoid, it gives you a horrible feeling, it's like being burgled - you feel violated.\"\n\nThe DVSA's head of law enforcement said it had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licenses in 2022\n\nThe Driving Standards Agency, (DVSA), which promotes road safety and sets standards for training, warns many online adverts promising full licences quickly are money-making scams which may only provide a fake licence. It adds only the Driving and Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) can issue a genuine driving licence.\n\nThe number of people being prosecuted for test fraud via impersonations are increasing, the DVSA says. If convicted, they face prison sentences and fines. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight months for taking approximately 150 theory and practical tests for other drivers.\n\nThe DVSA warns if people do not meet the necessary driving standards before taking control of a vehicle, it could cause serious injuries or even fatalities.\n\nIts head of law enforcement, Marian Kitson, said its investigation team was catching more people committing fraud and had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licences in 2022.\n\nIn the year from April 2022, it sent 30 cases - involving 497 offences - of fraud by false representation for prosecution and there were 53 arrests.\n\nHowever, Ms Kitson said it was clear from their investigations that there was even more occurring, adding that they did not know the true scale of the problem.\n\n\"The internet is so huge; the social media platforms are vast and these people are very clever, they move the adverts around; they change them frequently,\" she said.\n\n\"So actually, spotting them and taking action quickly is a real challenge.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

Watch: BBC shows Rick Astley round at his first Glastonbury\n\nThousands of fans gathered at the Pyramid Stage at midday, eager for the chance to be Rickrolled in person.\n\nAnd Astley didn't disappoint, rewarding them with a jubilant version of Never Gonna Give You Up that permanently redefined the term crowd-pleaser.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC before the show, he said being booked to play the festival was simultaneously \"a bizarre stroke of luck\" and \"pretty bonkers\".\n\n\"If we get the smallest audience on the 12 o'clock slot that Glastonbury's ever seen, I'm still OK with that,\" he told entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson.\n\nIn the end, he didn't have to worry. Early morning festivalgoers arrived in their droves, offering conclusive proof that the star is no stranger to love...\n\n\"I'm here for Rick Astley,\" said Debbie Anne O'Donovan, firmly planted in the front row two hours before the singer arrived.\n\n\"I've been a big fan since the 80s. He's a bit of a legend. I think he'll connect with the crowd really well.\"\n\nMother and daughter Penny and Corrie Wheeler reserved their places even earlier, at 07:30, and were determined to stay put until Guns N' Roses play their headline set.\n\n\"We do have provisions, we have plenty of snacks, so we're pretty set,\" said Corrie.\n\n\"I've seen him quite a few times,\" added Mark Old, who was watching with his wife. \"He's got a really cool, smooth voice and he's a fantastic performer.\"\n\nPenny (left) and Corrie Wheeler were amongst the first fans in the queue to see the star\n\nAstley took to the stage shortly after midday to the sound of the Star Wars theme, before launching into a disco-fied version Together Forever.\n\n\"My god, look at you,\" he declared, surveying the audience in a blush pink suit.\n\nHe didn't stay still for long, though, stalking the catwalk, reading out people's flags, serenading the front row and clearly having the time of his life.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with his back catalogue, he threw in covers of Chic's Good Times and Harry Styles's As It Was, the latter mixed with A-Ha's Take On Me.\n\nHe also took the opportunity of a nationwide TV audience to play his new single, Dippin' My Feet.\n\n\"I'm not an idiot!\" he announced with a wink, \"of course I'm going to play my new song\".\n\nThe singer rose to fame in the 1980s before a surprise career resurgence over the last decade\n\nThen he stepped behind the drum kit for AC/DC's Highway To Hell, explaining it was a song he'd play as \"a 15-year-old kid in my dad's greenhouse\" until his drum kit broke.\n\nAfter it ended, he apologised for his playing, saying his suit trousers kept getting caught in the kick drum pedal.\n\n\"All I can say, Glastonbury, is I'm sorry for wearing the wrong trousers.\"\n\nObviously, he saved Never Gonna Give You Up to the end, getting the crowd to sing the first verse and chorus with him a capella, then vamping on the groove for almost 10 minutes, introducing his band and throwing in the guitar solo for Queen's We Will Rock You for good measure.\n\nWhen he reached the final refrain of \"I just want to tell you how I'm feeling\", he ad-libbed: \"Glastonbury, I'm feeling fantastic, thanks to you.\"\n\nIt felt like a miniature version of Glastonbury's traditional Sunday afternoon legend slot. It'll be interesting to see how Cat Stevens, who fills that role tomorrow, will compare.\n\nThe audience stretched back as far as the eye could see\n\nNow 57 years old, Astley became an overnight sensation in 1987, when Never Gonna Give You Up topped the charts in 25 countries.\n\nA product of the Stock Aitken Waterman hit factory, it paired his rich, mellow baritone with a cheesy dance beat and an even cheesier video - and won the Brit Award for best single.\n\nOver the next four years, he had another seven top 10 hits with tracks like Whenever You Need Somebody and Cry For Help; but, frustrated by a lack of control over his career, he quit showbusiness in 1991.\n\nFor more than a decade, he lived in Richmond, raising his young daughter while his wife worked as a film producer.\n\nThen, in the early 2000s Never Gonna Give You Up enjoyed a bizarre second life as an internet meme: Rickrolling - where users are sent a link and duped into watching Astley's music video.\n\nBy 2021, the video's YouTube page had reached 1 billion views, . Today, it's nudging 1.4 billion.\n\nThe affable star takes his internet infamy in his stride, describing RickRolling as \"brilliant\" and \"funny\".\n\n\"The video and the song have drifted off into the ether and become something else, and I'm ever so grateful for it,\" he told the Associated Press in 2022.\n\nThe star made sure everyone felt part of the performance\n\nThe notoriety encouraged him out of retirement in 2016, since when he's been on a new creative streak, producing soulful and mature pop albums like 50 and Beautiful Life.\n\nThat led to him being invited to Glastonbury in 2020, before the festival was cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\n\"I thought to myself, 'That's it, that's my shot gone',\" he told the BBC. \"I didn't think we'd get invited back because time moves on and there's new artists coming along. So I was really, completely made up when they got in touch.\"\n\nAnd the star's Glastonbury journey won't end on the Pyramid Stage.

a moment that years later featured prominently in the second season of hit comedy Derry Girls.\n\nThe evening was rounded off when Bill and Hillary Clinton switched on the Christmas lights outside Belfast City Hall.\n\nBill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie attended the site of the Omagh bombing in September 1998\n\nMr Clinton would return to Northern Ireland again on 3 September 1998, five months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and just a month after the Omagh bombing.\n\nA Real IRA bomb killed 29 people in the County Tyrone town on 15 August 1998, the biggest single atrocity of the Troubles.\n\nWhilst there, Mr Clinton gave an address he gave his sympathies to the bereaved families and called for a new peace to be built following the agreement.\n\nThe president also met with Prime Minister Tony Blair and addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nHe also visited Armagh for a special Gathering for Peace on the Mall, where thousands turned out to hear them speak.\n\nHe shared the stage at that time with Mr Blair, former Northern Ireland Secretary, the late Mo Mowlam, and Northern Ireland's newly-appointed first and deputy first ministers, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.\n\nMr Clinton addressed people in a key note speech at the Odyssey Arena on 13 December 2000 during his third visit\n\nNearing the end of his time as President, Bill Clinton once more returned to Northern Ireland as part of his farewell tour.\n\nThis was at a time when the peace process is struggling and sectarian murder had returned to the streets.\n\nDuring the visit, Mr Clinton held talks in which he urged all sides not to give up trying to overcome the deadlock on decommissioning and demilitarisation.\n\nHe also delivered a keynote speech at the Odyssey in Belfast, in which he encouraged the implementation and progression of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBill Clinton given a jersey by the Belfast Giants hockey team\n\nMr Clinton's visit to Belfast culminated with a celebration outside City Hall.\n\nThe president switched on the city's festive lights in front of a huge Christmas tree donated to Belfast by the city of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThousands of people crammed into the city streets and cheered as the president wished them a peaceful Christmas.\n\nGeorg Bush met with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and then prime minister Tony Blair at Hillsborough Castle\n\nUS President George Bush visited Northern Ireland in April 2003 to hold talks over the political process in the country and the war in Iraq.\n\nThe visit began with a summit in Hillsborough Castle with then Prime Minster Tony Blair to discuss gains on the battlefield and plans for the leadership post-conflict in Iraq.\n\nAt the time the IRA leadership was under intense pressure to fully disarm and disband.\n\nNorthern Ireland's devolved institutions had been suspended since 14 October 2002 following a row over allegations of IRA activity, including alleged spying within the Northern Ireland Office.\n\nPresident Bush, Mr Blair and the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern met with Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, Sinn F\u00e9in President Gerry Adams and Mark Durkan of the SDLP - the leaders of the pro-Agreement parties who had remained in talks aimed at resurrecting the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nGeorge W Bush was welcomed at Stormont Castle by Peter Robinson and by Martin McGuinness\n\nOn 16 June 2008, Mr Bush made a one-day stop in Northern Ireland during his European farewell trip as his presidency came to an end.\n\nThe president was welcomed at Stormont Castle by then first and deputy first ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness.\n\nHe was later joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Taoiseach Brian Cowen.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness, the president said the progress made in Northern Ireland over the past 10 years was unimaginable.\n\nHe discussed investment issues and the devolution of policing and justice.\n\nHe then made visits to Lough View Integrated Primary School in Castlereagh - taking some time to hit the basketball court - and a community project in the city centre.\n\nSeveral hundred people demonstrated in Belfast city centre against his visit, with some climbing onto the roof of the City Hall with an Iraqi flag erected.\n\nThe protest at Belfast City Hall was organised by the Belfast Anti-War Movement representing trade unions and student and women'", "support for victims in these communities.\n\nBaroness Gohir said as a member and volunteer at MWNUK, Fawziyah was an intelligent and educated woman who knew her rights, \"yet she still ended up dead\".\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\u2022 None Man murdered wife by pushing her off Arthur's SeatOil prices have surged after several of the world's largest exporters announced surprise cuts in production.\n\nThe price of Brent crude oil is trading close to $85 a barrel after jumping by almost 6%.\n\nEconomists warned that higher oil prices could make it harder to bring down the cost of living.\n\nBut the RAC motoring group said it does not expect petrol prices to rise unless the higher oil price is sustained over several days.\n\nBrent crude prices rose after Saudi Arabia, Iraq and several Gulf states said on Sunday they were cutting output by more than one million barrels of oil a day.\n\nIn addition, Russia said it will extend its cut of half a million barrels per day until the end of the year.\n\nEnergy giants BP and Shell saw their share prices rise on Monday, with both rising more than 4%.\n\nOil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began.\n\nHowever, the US has been calling for producers to increase output in order to push energy prices lower. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council said: \"We don't think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty - and we've made that clear.\"\n\nHigh energy and fuel prices have helped to drive up inflation - the rate at which prices rise - putting pressure on many households' finances.\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that the oil price surge could make the battle to bring down inflation harder.\n\nHowever, she said that rising oil prices won't necessarily lead to higher household energy bills.\n\n\"The energy price cap, that households benefit from, has already been determined using earlier market expectations,\" she said. \"Plus, when you look at energy use in households, it tends to be more gas-heavy rather than oil.\"\n\nThere have also been fears that there could be an impact on transport costs, if fuel prices rise.\n\nThe RAC said it does not expect this to happen in the short-term.\n\n\"Any sudden increase in the cost of oil shouldn't result in a rise in the UK average price of petrol for a fortnight, unless of course the barrel price stays higher for several days,\" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC.\n\nThe reduction in output is being made by members of the Opec+ oil producers. The group accounts for about 40% of all the world's crude oil output.\n\nSaudi Arabia is reducing output by 500,000 barrels per day and Iraq by 211,000. The UAE, Kuwait, Algeria and Oman are also making cuts.\n\nA Saudi energy ministry official said the move was \"a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market\", the official Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nNathan Piper, an independent oil analyst, told the BBC the move by Opec+ appeared to be an attempt to keep the oil price above $80 a barrel in the medium term, given that demand could be hit by a weakening global economy and sanctions have had a \"limited impact\" on restricting Russian oil supplies.\n\nThis surprise announcement is significant for several reasons.\n\nDespite price fluctuations in recent months, there were concerns that global demand for oil would outstrip supply, especially towards the end of the year. The increase in oil prices following Sunday's announcement could potentially put more pressure on inflation - worsening the cost-of-living crisis and raising the risk of recession.\n\nInterestingly, this announcement came just a day before the Opec+ meeting. There were indications from members that they would stick to the same production policy, meaning there would be no fresh cuts, which is why it has come as a huge surprise.\n\nThe development will also likely further strain ties between the US and Saudi Arabia-led Opec+. The White House had called on the group to increase supplies to cool down prices and check Russian finances.\n\nHowever, Sunday's announcement also underlines the close cooperation between oil-producing countries and Russia.\n\nThe latest reductions come on top of a cut announced by Opec+ in October last year of two million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nHowever, last year's cut came despite calls from the US and other countries for oil producers to pump more crude.\n\nWhen the Opec+ group announced its production cuts in October, US President Joe Biden said he was \"disappointed by the short-sighted decision\".Father-of-four Pat McCormick was described as a gentle man who was the victim of a brutal and sustained assault\n\nA man who murdered a County Down father of four, disposed of his body in a wheelie bin and dumped it in a lake must serve at least 16 years in prison before being considered for release.\n\nPat McCormick's body was discovered near Ballygowan six weeks after he was last seen on CCTV in Comber.\n\nDavid Gill, 30, of no fixed abode, was sentenced on Thursday after admitting the murder of the 55-year-old.\n\nFive people were sentenced in connection with Mr McCormick's murder.\n\nSpeaking to media gathered outside the court in Belfast afterwards, Mr McCormick's 18-year-old daughter Morgan paid tribute to her dad.\n\n\"We've been stripped of our father,\" she said.\n\n\"My dad will never get to see any of us grow up or get married. He'll never get to hold his future grandkids.\n\n\"We leave here today with memories of our dad who has been taken from us. However those memories are filled with love and happiness, and they're memories that we'll all hold on to forever.\"\n\nMr McCormick was lured to a flat in Comber on the evening of 30 May 2019.\n\nThe 55-year-old believed he was going to meet Gill's fianc\u00e9e Lesley Ann Dodds, with whom he had had a brief relationship.\n\nDodds, 25, from Queen Victoria Gardens in Belfast, was sentenced to five-and-a-half years after admitting manslaughter, with half of that term to be served in prison.\n\nMr McCormick had received messages from Dodds' Facebook account, saying she had left Gill and asking him to come to her flat.\n\nInstead, when Mr McCormick arrived, only Gill was at the flat.\n\nThe judge at Belfast Crown Court said Mr McCormick had been the victim of a \"brutal and sustained assault\".\n\nThe court heard his cause of death was 24 rib fractures due to blunt force trauma.\n\nMr McCormick was described in court as being \"devoted to his family, thoughtful, gentle and caring\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

There was at this stage no evidence to suggest a foreign state was involved, they said.\n\nRussian gas deliveries had been suspended before the blasts. Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in August last year, saying it needed maintenance. Nord Stream 2 had never been put into service.\n\nThe exact cause of the 26 September blasts that hit the natural gas pipelines is unknown, but it is widely believed they were attacked.\n\nNato and Western leaders have stopped short of directly accusing Russia of attacking its own pipelines, although the EU has previously said Russia uses its gas pipelines as a weapon against the West.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times reported that new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group had carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.\n\nCiting anonymous US officials, the report said there was no evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation.\n\nThe US newspaper reported that the officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or \"any details of the strength of the evidence it contains\".\n\nIt added: \"Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two.\"\n\nResponding to the New York Times report, Mr Podolyak added that Kyiv had no information about what had happened.\n\nMeanwhile, German website Die Zeit reported that German authorities had made a breakthrough in their investigation into the cause of the attacks.\n\nAccording to joint research by several German media organisations, the boat used to plant the explosives was a yacht hired from a firm based in Poland, which reportedly belonged to two Ukrainians. The nationalities of those who carried out the attack were unclear.\n\nGerman investigators later refused to confirm details of the report but said that a ship had been searched seven weeks ago.\n\nDefence Minister Boris Pistorius warned against jumping to conclusions. It could be a false-flag operation aimed at pinning the blame on pro-Ukrainian groups, he told German radio: \"The likelihood of one [theory] or the other is just as high.\"\n\nAt least 50m (164ft) of the underwater Nord Stream 1 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany is thought to have been destroyed by September's blast.\n\nDanish police believe \"powerful explosions\" blew four holes in the pipe and its newer twin, Nord Stream 2.\n\nGerman, Danish and Swedish authorities have all been investigating the incident.\n\nMr Peskov said Nord Stream shareholder countries should insist on an urgent, transparent investigation.\n\n\"We are still not allowed in the investigation,\" he said. \"Only a few days ago we received notes to that effect from the Danes and Swedes. This whole thing is not just weird. It reeks of a heinous crime.\"\n\nFor decades, Russia supplied huge amounts of natural gas to Western Europe. But after the war in Ukraine began in February of last year, most EU countries drastically reduced their reliance on Russian energy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Chris Kaba, who was shot by police in September, had been due to become a father\n\nFour men have appeared at the Old Bailey accused of plotting a murder with Chris Kaba, who was shot dead by a Met Police officer last year.\n\nMr Kaba, 24, died the day after he was hit by a single gunshot in Streatham Hill, south London, on 5 September.\n\nThe alleged offences relate to a shooting days earlier in Tower Hamlets in east London.

This is typically when the weather is best for crossing the Channel.\n\nA revised deal with the French authorities to stop migrant crossings prevented 33,000 illegal crossings last year, Mr Sunak added.\n\nUnder the new agreement, signed by Home Secretary Suella Braverman in November, the UK paid France \u00a363m this year to invest in CCTV, policing and detention centres in French ports to try to prevent crossings.\n\nThe prime minister added: \"With grit and determination, the government can fix this and we are using every tool at our disposal.\"\n\nAn estimated 500 male migrants will be housed on the Bibby Stockholm\n\nAnd Mr Sunak said the UK had gone from accepting about one in five Albanian asylum cases to just one in 50.\n\n\"So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%\" year-on-year, he said.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government promoting a \"policy that doesn't work\" which is \"costing a fortune for the taxpayer\".\n\nSir Keir said the promise of further measures to tackle the crisis was \"like Groundhog Day\" as crossings continue this year.\n\nHome Office figures show about 7,600 people had been detected crossing the Channel so far this year.\n\nIn total, 45,755 migrants crossed the Channel in 2022, the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.\n\nCrossings are heavily influenced by the weather and the summer months typically see higher numbers making the journey.\n\nThe government's Illegal Migration Bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords. The bill, which will place a legal duty on the home secretary to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, has been heavily criticised by peers.\n\nThe measures, unveiled in March, are a key part of prime ministers plan to stop small boats crossing the English Channel - which he has made a priority ahead of the next general election.Coolio recorded eight studio albums and won an American Music Award and three MTV Video Music Awards\n\nThe death of US Grammy-winning rapper Coolio in September 2022 was due to the effects of fentanyl and other drugs, his manager has said.\n\nJarez Posey said the musician's family had been informed about the findings by the Los Angeles County coroner.\n\nThe artist was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of a friend's LA house six months ago. He was 59.\n\nCoolio, whose real name was Artis Leon Ivey Jr, won a Grammy for the 1995 track Gangsta's Paradise.\n\nThe hit - later chosen as the soundtrack to the film Dangerous Minds - went on to become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, helping to bring the genre into the mainstream.\n\nIt continues to be widely listened to and has passed a billion views on YouTube.\n\nAt the time of his death, the rapper was suffering from heart disease and asthma, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports.\n\nWhile Coolio had recently used phencyclidine, or PCP, his death was as a result of the effects of a cocktail of fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamines, CBS said.\n\nCoolio started making music in the 80s, but he cemented his place in hip-hop history when he recorded Gangsta's Paradise.\n\nHe was born in Pennsylvania, but grew up in the LA suburb of Compton, where his career flourished and he became a leading figure in the US West Coast rap music scene in the 90s.\n\nHis rap moniker came from a conversation with a friend who asked him: \"Who do you think you are, Coolio Iglesias?\", according to The Black Names Project website.\n\nHe worked as a volunteer firefighter in the San Jose area before dedicating himself full-time to hip-hop.\n\nA talented producer and actor, he appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother in the UK in 2009.\n\nAnd he even found an outlet for his love of food with a book and internet series, Cooking with Coolio.\n\nOver a career spanning four decades he recorded eight studio albums and won an American Music Award and three MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nHis other hits included Fantastic Voyage, Rollin' With My Homies, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New), and Too Hot.Italy has moved to block a Chinese state-owned company from taking control of tyre making giant Pirelli.\n\nThe decision is part of measures announced by Italy's government to protect Pirelli's independence.\n\nBeijing-controlled chemical giant Sinochem is Pirelli's biggest shareholder, with a 37% stake in the 151-year-old Milan-based firm.\n\nIt comes as tensions between Beijing and the West are in focus as the US secretary of state visits China.\n\nOn Sunday, Pirelli said in a statement to investors that the Italian government had ruled that only Camfin - a company controlled by Pirelli's boss Marco Tronchetti Provera - could nominate candidates to be its chief executive.\n\nPirelli also said the government had decided that any changes to the company's corporate governance should be subject to official scrutiny.\n\nIt came after Sinochem told the Italian government in March that it planned to renew and update an existing shareholder pact.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's administration examined the agreement under the so-called \"Golden Power Procedure\" rules, which are aimed at protecting businesses that are viewed as strategically important to the nation.\n\nIn 2015, Pirelli was sold for \u20ac7.1bn (\u00a36.1bn; $7.8bn) to a group of investors including ChemChina and Camfin. Six years later ChemChina merged with state-owned Sinochem. The Chinese government's Silk Road investment fund also owns a 9% stake in Pirelli.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Beijing, on his final day of a rare visit to China by such a high-ranking Washington official.\n\nMr Blinken's trip comes as the relationships between China and many Western nations have deteriorated in recent years over issues including trade, Taiwan and security.\n\nBefore his visit officials saw little chance of any breakthrough on the many disputes between the world's two biggest economies, which include Washington's attempts to slow the development of China's computer chip industry.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Shelby Lynn, 24, from Ballymena, went to see Rammstein in Vilnius\n\nA woman from Northern Ireland has told the BBC she was recruited and \"groomed\" for sex with the lead singer of the German heavy metal band Rammstein.\n\nShelby Lynn, who also claims her drink was spiked at a concert in Vilnius in May, first made the claims on social media.\n\nHer allegations triggered a wave of other sexual misconduct allegations against the band's frontman Till Lindemann.\n\nThe band have denied the claims.\n\nA spokesman for Rammstein told the BBC an internal investigation was under way with the first results expected early next week.\n\nThe band, well known for its flamboyant shows and controversial lyrics, has been engulfed by scandal in recent weeks as a growing number of women claim that they were recruited for sex during concerts.\n\nLike Ms Lynn, some suspect they were pre-selected on social media by a Russian woman, believed to have been a \"recruiter\" for Mr Lindemann, who invited them to parties before and after the show.\n\nShe also gave them access to a restricted area directly in front of the stage, known as \"Row Zero\".\n\nMs Lynn, who is 24 and from Ballymena in County Antrim, told the BBC that when she arrived at the venue a man named Joe asked her and other young women to line up.\n\nShe said: \"He started filming... about four girls, including myself. He got very close to our faces.\"\n\nMs Lynn says singer Till Lindemann reacted angrily when she told him she would not have sex with him\n\nShe claimed that shortly", "least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway.\n\n\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says.\n\nSome of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.\n\nPfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company \"monitored and reported all adverse event data\" to licensing authorities, \"in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.\"\n\nIt added: \"Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression.\" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated \"as required\".\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.\n\nUntil then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week.\n\nNow NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.\n\nA Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: \"Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.\"\n\nA lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves.\n\nDr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: \"It led to complete havoc in my life,\" he says. \"I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.\"\n\nThe panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction.\n\n\"I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.\"\n\nHe said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place.\n\nPanorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.\n\nWatch The Antidepressant Story on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 June (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)\n\nHe is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping.\n\n\"To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,\" he said.\n\n\"We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.\"\n\nNow Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.\n\nAt the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.\n\nDespite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone.\n\nDr Horowitz is still trying to reduce his antidepressant dose - and hopes to stop altogether this year\n\nThe Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.\n\u2022 None Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdogThe stepfather of a five-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to her murder.\n\nNadia Zofia Kalinowska died after being found injured at her family home at Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey in December 2019.\n\nHer mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder.\n\nWhen the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nThe Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year.\n\nA minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.\n\nThe trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.\n\nDuring the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.\n\nAs well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.\n\nAlso present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.\n\nNadia was rushed to hospital from her home in Newtownabbey\n\nThis led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death.\n\nAs the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned.\n\nAt this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.\n\nAleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.\n\nThese pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.\n\nShe was remanded back into custody.\n\nAddressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each", "] counterparts to resolve this incident,\" it said.\n\nIt is unclear where or in what conditions PV2 King is being held.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told the BBC that authorities in the North were likely to \"try pump information out of him\" about his military service and \"try to coerce him into becoming a propaganda tool\".\n\nThe Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separates the two Koreas and is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.\n\nIt is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing and surveillance cameras. Armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day.\n\nThe DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war.\n\nDozens of people try to escape North Korea every year, fleeing poverty and famine, but defections across the DMZ are extremely dangerous and rare. The country sealed its borders in 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to reopen them.\n\nThe last time a soldier defected at the JSA was in 2017, when a North Korean soldier drove a vehicle, then ran by foot across the military demarcation line, South Korea said at the time.\n\nThe soldier was shot at 40 times, but survived.\n\nBefore the pandemic more than 1,000 people fled from North Korea to China every year, according to numbers released by the South Korean government.\n\nThe detention of the soldier presents a major foreign policy headache for US President Joe Biden. PV2 King is believed to be the only American citizen currently in North Korean custody. Six South Koreans remain in detention there.\n\nRelations between the US and the North plummeted in 2017 after US student Otto Warmbier, who had been arrested a year earlier for stealing a propaganda sign, was returned to the US in a comatose state and later died.\n\nHis family blames the North Korean authorities for his death.\n\nThree US citizens were later freed during Donald Trump's presidency in 2018. But ultimately, a series of talks held between Kim Jong Un and the former US president did little to improve the relationship.\n\nNorth Korea has since tested dozens of increasingly powerful missiles that could carry nuclear warheads, which have been met by a slew of sanctions by the US and its allies.\n\nThe detention of the US national comes on the same day as a US nuclear-capable submarine docked in South Korea for the first time since 1981.\n\nThe submarine was specifically supplied to help the country deal with the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.\n\nAhead of its deployment there were threats of retaliation from the authorities in Pyongyang, which warned the US that sending nuclear weapons to the peninsula could spark a nuclear crisis.About half a million people are being evacuated to safer areas in south-eastern Bangladesh, ahead of a cyclone that could be extremely dangerous.\n\nMocha is predicted to make landfall at midday, with 170kph (106mph) winds and storm surges of up to 3.6m (12ft).\n\nThere are concerns the cyclone could hit the world's largest refugee camp, Cox's Bazar, where close to a million people live in makeshift homes.\n\nRains are already falling on the camp and red warning flags have been raised.\n\nCyclone Mocha could be the most powerful storm seen in Bangladesh in nearly two decades.\n\nAs the weather system heads towards the Bangladesh-Myanmar coast, nearby airports have been shut, fishermen have been told to suspend their work and 1,500 shelters have been set up, as people from vulnerable areas are moved to safety.\n\n\"We are ready to face any hazards... we don't want to lose a single life,\" Vibhushan Kanti Das, additional deputy commissioner at Cox's Bazar, told the BBC.\n\nPeople are packing in to cyclone shelters as the storm approaches\n\nThroughout the day, families have been arriving at designated cyclone shelters. Hundreds have been packing into classrooms at a school in Cox's Bazar.\n\nSome brought plastic bags filled with a few of their possessions. Others arrived with their livestock, chickens and cattle.\n\nJannat, 17, took a space on a classroom desk, along with her two-month-old baby. She brought a few clothes with her in a bag, but nothing else. Her husband was still at their coastal home, making sure things were safely secure before joining her.\n\nShe said she was scared about this cyclone, after her home was damaged in Cyclone Sitrang last year too.\n\n\"I am worried about what comes next,' Jannat told the BBC. \"I'm scared my home will be submerged again.\"\n\nClose to a million Rohingya refugees who have fled neighbouring Myanmar (also known as Burma) remain at risk, living in flimsy bamboo shelters with tarpaulin covers. The UN says it is doing what it can to protect these areas.\n\nBangladesh's government does not allow refugees to leave their camps, so many say they are frightened and unsure of what will happen if their shelters are hit by the storm.\n\nMohammad Rafique (centre) says all he and his family can do is pray\n\nMohammad Rafique, 40, and his family live in one of the small bamboo shelters built for refugees.\n\nSuch shelters with tarpaulin roofing are unlikely to provide much protection from strong winds and heavy rains.\n\nAll we can do is pray to God to save us, Mohammad says. \"We have nowhere to go for safety, and no-one to turn to.\"\n\nHe adds: \"We have faced many difficulties before and our homes have been destroyed in the past. We hope it won't happen this time.\"\n\nForecasters expect the cyclone to bring a deluge of rain, which can trigger landslides - a serious danger for those who reside in hillside camps, where landslips are a regular phenomenon.\n\nMD Shamsul Douza, from the Bangladeshi government office which oversees the refugees and the camps, told the BBC that they were working with NGOs to ensure the camps were as prepared as possible for the cyclone.\n\nBut he said moving refugees out of the camps was not an easy task.\n\n\"Moving a million refugees is very difficult, the implementation of the movement is difficult. We have to be practical,\" the official said.\n\n\"Our plan is to save lives. We are also focused on the days after. There may be heavy rains leading to flash floods and landslides, which would also pose a risk.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons.\n\nAs a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRishi Sunak says legal migration to the UK is \"too high\" but has refused to put a precise figure on acceptable levels of people coming to the UK.\n\nThe prime minister told the BBC he was \"considering a range of options\" to bring down legal migration.\n\nHe has been facing pressure to deliver on a 2019 Conservative manifesto commitment to bring down levels of net migration.\n\nNew figures on net migration to the UK are expected next Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, Mr Sunak refused to be drawn on the specifics of the government's plan on legal migration.\n\nAsked if he would stop some international students bringing dependants with them when they come to study in the UK, Mr Sunak said he wouldn't \"speculate\".\n\n\"What I would say is we're considering a range of options to help tackle numbers of legal migration and to bring those numbers down", "available.\n\nThere is no suggestion there will be any kind of formal review.\n\nLast week, one head teacher said the reading test included some \"GCSE-level\" questions.\n\nIt has fuelled a debate among teachers and parents about the purpose of Sats.\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) previously told BBC News that Sats were \"designed to be challenging\".\n\nMinisters will not have access to the reading paper before it becomes publicly available next week.\n\nMr Gibb said the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) - which is part of the DfE - tested the paper last year \"with a large group of children\".\n\n\"They monitored the response of those children to the test, to the questions, they found that 85% [enjoyed] taking the test,\" he said.\n\nHe said Sats \"do have to test a range of ability to make sure that we can show what proportion of children are exceeding the standard\".\n\n\"But we don't want these tests to be too hard for children. That's not the purpose,\" he said.\n\n\"The purpose is to test the range of ability and the Standards and Testing Agency is charged with making sure that these tests are appropriate for this age group.\"\n\nHe added: \"I will certainly look at this because I know that there has been concern expressed by some schools.\"\n\nStandard Assessment Tests, or Sats, are tests that children take in Year 6, at the end of Key Stage 2. They are national curriculum assessments in English grammar, punctuation and spelling, English reading and maths.\n\nThe government's Standards and Testing Agency says the purpose of Sats tests are to:\n\nChildren also sit Sats in Year 2, at the end of Key Stage 1.\n\nLast year, 59% of Year 6 pupils met the expected levels in reading, writing and maths - down from 65% in 2019.\n\nThe national curriculum tests were cancelled in 2020 and 2021, during the pandemic.No service is running on any of the Tube lines\n\nLondoners are facing widespread transport disruption as strike action halts the Underground.\n\nTransport for London's (TfL) website shows no services are running on any Tube lines.\n\nRMT and Aslef members are involved in a dispute over job cuts, pensions and conditions.

People are also being encouraged to walk or cycle if they are able to.\n\nAslef are warning that more strike action could go ahead if negotiations fail\n\nAslef district organiser Finn Brennan told the BBC outside Brixton station that he is \"genuinely sorry for the people affected.\"\n\n\"We are prepared to negotiate and talk about changes, but our members are rightly not prepared to accept change being imposed.\n\nHe added that further strikes are \"very likely\".\n\nThere have been seven London Underground strikes in the past 12 month, according to TfL.\n\nBuses and trams were busier than usual\n\nTube and Elizabeth line services are expected to start much later than normal on Thursday morning due to the previous day's strike.\n\nNational rail strike action is also expected to have an impact in the capital on Thursday and into Friday morning, with an amended Elizabeth line timetable and possible further disruption to DLR, Elizabeth line and London Overground services.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP for Harrow East, Bob Blackman asked Rishi Sunak if he would join him in condemning the strikes which he said \"have brought misery to the travelling public\", and also condemning London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"for his failure to address this\".\n\nThe prime minister said: \"[Mr Blackman] is absolutely right about the misery being inflicted on Londoners by the incompetent running of TfL.\"\n\nHe said the mayor had received \u00a36bn in additional funding for transport services, adding: \"So for us to be in a situation that we find ourselves in today is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor of London said: \"No one wants to see strikes and the disruption across the country this week is particularly bad news for many of the capital's businesses who are struggling with inflation and the cost of doing business.\n\n\"The mayor has repeatedly made clear that the government's insistence on including a review into pension reform as part of the emergency funding deal for TfL was unwarranted and had the potential to lead to this kind of industrial action.\"\n\nThe Elizabeth line is running with a good service but it is not stopping at every station\n\nTfL's chief operating officer Glynn Barton apologised to customers and urged trade unions \"to call off this action and continue to engage with us to avoid disruption to our customers\".\n\nBut Mick Lynch, the RMT's general secretary, said: \"Our members will never accept job losses, attacks on their pensions or changes to working conditions in order to pay for a funding cut which is the government's political decision.\"\n\nHe added staff \"deserve decent pensions, job security and good working conditions, and the RMT will fight tooth and nail to make sure that's what they get\".\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"This government has committed over \u00a36bn since the start of the pandemic to support London's transport network - how that money is spent is a decision for the mayor\".\n\nThe Tube strike that has halted the network isn't about pay. The roots of it actually lie in the pandemic and the loss of passengers.\n\nThen the government bailed out Transport for London (TfL) financially but there were strings attached.\n\nBroadly TfL has to make \u00a3900m savings. Some 600 posts are being closed - the unions say that will leave stations with fewer staff which they say isn't safe.\n\nTfL says passenger safety is always a priority. And the crucial issue: TfL has had to carry out a pension review.\n\nEven carrying out the review has sparked the strikes, even though proposals for any change haven't been outlined. Changes will have to be agreed with the government.\n\nPensions are a red line for the unions and it is difficult to see how this will be resolved unless they stay as they are.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I have no idea who this woman is. This is a fake story,\" he said.\n\nHe accused the civil trial's presiding judge of anti-Trump bias and said that his decision not to testify in person would not have made any difference to the outcome.\n\nThe jury's verdict marked the first time Mr Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than two dozen women, was found legally responsible for assault.\n\nMs Carroll, a writer and long-time advice columnist, claimed Mr Trump raped her inside a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room and has defamed her by calling her allegation \"a hoax and a lie\".\n\nThe jury of six men and three women deliberated for less than three hours on Tuesday before reaching their decision.\n\nThe standard of proof in civil cases is lower than in criminal cases, meaning that jurors were only required to find that it was more likely than not that Mr Trump assaulted Ms Carroll.\n\nWhile the jury found Mr Trump liable for sexual battery and defamation of Ms Carroll, they did not find Mr Trump liable of raping her. To do so, the jury would have needed to have been convinced that Mr Trump had engaged in non-consensual sexual intercourse with Ms Carroll.\n\nMr Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina told reporters outside the courtroom that it was \"a strange verdict\".\n\n\"They rejected her rape claim and she always claimed this was a rape case, so it's a little perplexing,\" he said.\n\nHe added that, in Mr Trump's hometown of New York, where the former president is now unpopular, \"you just can't get a fair trial\".\n\nThe case will now move to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nMs Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan earlier expressed confidence to US media that Mr Trump has \"no legitimate arguments for appeal\".\n\n\"I've rarely felt more confident about an appeal than I do about this one,\" she said.\n\nMs Kaplan also told the New York Times that her client was giving \"serious consideration\" toward filing a new defamation suit against Mr Trump over his latest comments on CNN.\n\nMr Trump is currently the frontrunner to once again win the Republican nomination for president in 2024, earning more than 50% support in national polls, including several conducted after the New York trial began.Susan Hart's daughters said she had been showing signs of dementia\n\nA grandmother who went missing on holiday on a Greek island three weeks ago has been found dead in a remote area.\n\nSusan Hart, 74, from Bath, was in Telendos with her husband, Ed, when she disappeared on 30 April.\n\nMrs Hart could not be found after her husband went rock climbing while she planned to read a book.\n\nHer daughter Ruth Landale said she was identified by her stepfather and the family were heartbroken.\n\nMs Landale said they were now waiting for her body to be repatriated to Switzerland where she was living.\n\nA post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out in Greece.\n\nMrs Hart has three daughters who grew up in Bath but now live in Canada, Australia and London with their young families.\n\nMs Landale said her mother had been showing symptoms of dementia over the last few years, but had not yet received a diagnosis.\n\n\"It's been a stressful and distressing time for the whole family,\" she said.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman confirmed staff were providing consular assistance to the family and were in contact with local authorities.\n\nThe BBC has asked police in Greece to comment.\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

plane he was on went missing\n\nCardiff City has been ordered to pay Nantes the transfer balance for Emiliano Sala, who died in a plane crash before he could play for the Welsh side.\n\nThe BBC has been told that Fifa has told the Championship club to pay more than \u20ac11m (\u00a39.45m).\n\nThat covers the last two instalments of the \u20ac17m agreed between the clubs.\n\nMeanwhile, French prosecutors have confirmed several employees of FC Nantes have been arrested.\n\nThat is as part of an investigation into money laundering and tax fraud.\n\nIn a statement, Nantes public prosecutor's office said the FC Nantes club manager, his deputy general manager and two people, including a players' agent, were placed in police custody but have since been released pending an investigation.\n\nCardiff City has been in dispute with FC Nantes over the transfer fee since the striker's death in January 2019.\n\nThe Argentine had just become Cardiff City's \u00a315m record signing when the plane carrying him from France to Wales crashed into the English Channel.\n\nIn May, the club said it would continue legal action against FC Nantes through the French courts after a Swiss Federal Tribunal decided the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) did not have the power to deal with the club's claim for damages.\n\nArgentine artist Gabriel Griffa painted this mural of the player in Carquefou, near Nantes\n\nCardiff failed in its appeal to the CAS over the Fifa ruling, and in January paid the first instalment, believed to be around \u00a37m, of the Sala fee to Nantes.\n\nOn Friday, the club issued a statement confirming the decision", "used to cover a \u00a3245,000 bill for his lawyers during the Partygate inquiry, opposition MPs say.\n\nAn inquiry by MPs found the former prime minister had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties.\n\nThe top lawyers defending Mr Johnson were paid for with taxpayer funds.\n\nLabour says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should demand Mr Johnson \"pays back every penny\" of public money used to fund his legal defence.\n\nThe government has sought to justify the decision by claiming there is a precedent for supporting former ministers with legal representation.\n\nBut the government has not been able to name a single example of a former minister receiving taxpayer-funded legal support for a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Conservative ministers had \"utterly failed\" to produce evidence to back up their assertion that funding Mr Johnson's legal defence followed convention.\n\n\"This murky arrangement that has seen the public left to pick up the tab for Boris Johnson's Partygate legal bills is not only without precedent but without justification,\" Ms Rayner said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to \"do the decent thing and force Johnson to pay the bill himself\".\n\n\"It's frankly unbelievable that hardworking taxpayers are being left to foot the bill for Boris Johnson's shameful antics,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said.\n\nThe SNP's leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: \"The legal costs, which the public have paid for, need to be recouped from Mr Johnson.\"\n\nMr Johnson's spokesperson referred to the government's response, explaining there is a long-standing position on legal support, justified by precedent.\n\nThe inquiry by the Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about gatherings in government buildings during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nIn an unprecedented decision, the committee found Mr Johnson had committed repeated contempts of Parliament with his Partygate denials.\n\nIn its conclusions, the committee said criticisms of the inquiry in opinions submitted by Mr Johnson's legal advisers were \"without merit\".\n\nMr Johnson said the inquiry amounted to a \"political assassination\", and branded the committee's findings \"deranged\".\n\nThe Cabinet Office made the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs for the inquiry last year, when he was still prime minister.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to two former ministers who were investigated by MPs for misleading Parliament and were not given legal support.\n\nThe former Labour MP and transport secretary, Stephen Byers, was not offered legal support when he faced a four-month inquiry in 2005.\n\nNor was the former Labour MP and paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, who was found to have \"inadvertently\" misled MPs in 2001.\n\nIn a response to a parliamentary question this week, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin defended the decision to pay Mr Johnson's legal costs.\n\nHe said the principle \"can also be applied to parliamentary inquiries, where it relates to one's conduct as minister of the Crown\".\n\nBut Mr Quin provided no examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for parliamentary inquiries.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe MP who submitted the question, Labour's Karl Turner, said that the Cabinet Office had \"created a precedent\" with the decision to fund Mr Johnson's legal defence.\n\nThis meant there was now a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers receive legal support to fight parliamentary inquiries, and backbench MPs do not, he added.\n\n\"We cannot have a system that unfairly advantages one member as against another member, in terms of having their excessively large legal bills covered by the taxpayer,\" Mr Turner said.\n\n\"Mr Johnson is a multi-millionaire if he wants to instruct the country's leading public lawyers and solicitors then let him pay for it.\"\n\nLast month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.\n\nThe Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.Lola James died at the Noah's Ark children's hospital in Cardiff on 21 July, 2020\n\nA mother accused of causing or allowing the death of her two-year-old daughter told police: \"I wouldn't hurt her, she's my baby, my shadow\".\n\nLola James died in hospital as a result of a \"catastrophic\" head injury in July 2020.\n\nSwansea Crown Court heard Sinead James told officers she was not responsible for her daughter's injuries.\n\nThe 30-year-old denies causing or allowing the death of Lola four months after her partner moved in.\n\nHer partner, Kyle Bevan, 31, of Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, denies murdering Lola at their home in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.\n\nMs James told police the first she knew about what had happened was when Mr Bevan ran into her bedroom to tell her she needed to get up, saying: \"There's an ambulance coming for Lola, she's limp.\"\n\nMs James said Mr Bevan later told her the family dog had jumped on Lola and knocked her down the stairs.\n\nShe said she called her mother and an ambulance.\n\nShe then went downstairs to see Lola, who was on the living room sofa.\n\nMs James said she told Mr Bevan to put her down as he began to pick her up.\n\nThe court heard she told police: \"I haven't done anything to her, she's my baby.\"\n\nShe told officers Lola was accident prone with \"two left feet\" and that she \"doesn't sleep and falls over everything\".\n\nShe said: \"I wish I was there, I wish I could have stopped it.\"\n\nWhen asked about her relationship with Mr Bevan, Ms James said they had met online and were sleeping together.\n\nShe said: \"I don't believe for a second he would have hurt her.\"\n\nShe said he was \"amazing\" with Lola.\n\nMs James told police that if she had to choose between Lola and Mr Bevan: \"I'd walk away, his bags would be packed and he'd be gone.\"\n\nWhen she saw video during a police interview of Mr Bevan holding Lola up she wanted to \"punch him in the face\".\n\nPolice said the footage depicted Bevan picking her up and letting her \"flop back\" to \"show his mother she couldn't stand up\".\n\nThe court heard he had not yet called an ambulance when it was filmed.\n\nBefore seeing the footage, Ms James said: \"Why didn't he call an ambulance straight away?\"\n\nAs she watched, Ms James said: \"He's not even holding her properly, I feel sick.\n\n\"I want to punch him in the face. He's probably caused her more damage. Why would he do that to a baby?\"\n\nShe said he should be protecting her and called the video \"sickening\".\n\nThe court heard she told police: \"If he can do that what has actually happened to my baby?\"\n\nShe told them she did not know whether she thought Mr Bevan's behaviour was controlling.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAt least 24 injured people have been taken to hospital after a \"devastating\" tornado hit Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the city's mayor.\n\nThe twister churned through the state's capital city on Friday, flipping cars, smashing roofs and toppling trees.\n\nSeveral blocks have been heavily damaged, according to aerial footage posted by the Weather Channel.\n\nNearly 90 million people in 15 US states are under threat from an \"explosive\" storm system.\n\nA state of emergency has also been declared in Missouri and two tornados were reported in Iowa.\n\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard after what she described as \"significant", ", he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.\n\nA spokesperson for the school said: \"Our school community is still in shock at this terrible tragedy.

He was buried a day before Thursday's sentencing.\n\nMiller apologised to the community and turned to address Ms Graber's relatives seated behind him.\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry for the distress I have caused you and the devastation I have caused your family,\" he said.\n\nPleading with the judge to forego the maximum sentence, Miller said: \"I don't want to be institutionalised so long that I forget who I am and where I come from.\"\n\nProsecutors said the evidence showed both Miller and Goodale had bludgeoned Ms Graber with a bat during the attack in Fairfield, a town of fewer than 10,000 people that lies 100 miles (160km) south-east of the state capitol, Des Moines.\n\nThe day after the attack, police found the mother-of-three's body hidden under a tarpaulin, wheelbarrow and railway sleepers in a local park where she used to walk after school.\n\nIn a police interview, Miller described frustrations with the way Ms Graber taught Spanish.\n\nHe said his marks in her class were lowering his Grade Point Average, an important score during applications for US colleges and scholarships.\n\nMiller met Ms Graber at Fairfield High School on the day of the murder to discuss his poor grade in her class. Goodale was also a student there.\n\nMexican-born Ms Graber had been employed at the school since 2012. She was part of the town's small but growing Latino community.Yevgeny Prigozhin may have boasted he had the loyalty of all 25,000 members of his mercenary army, but it seems that may have shifted as quickly as the Wagner Group's rebellion petered out.\n\nIn online messages analysed by BBC Verify, Wagner troops and their relatives raged against Prigozhin's decision to halt his dramatic march on Moscow and withdraw from the captured city of Rostov.\n\n\"The bald waste of space destroyed Wagner PMC with his own hands. And screwed everyone he could,\" fumed one online poster claiming to be a Wagner fighter on a Telegram channel with 200,000 followers.\n\n\"It's been another senseless revolt,\" they added.\n\nTelegram is the social media platform of choice for Wagner soldiers and pro-war circles in Russia, allowing often anonymous communication with thousands of followers at a time.\n\nIt was where Prigozhin chose to announce his so-called \"March of Justice\" against the Russian regime, but it has now become the place where many have turned against him.\n\nMark Krutov, a journalist with the RFE/RL outlet's Russian Service, has access to the Telegram group chats used by relatives of Wagner fighters. He shared some of their messages with the BBC.\n\n\"They were simply betrayed,\" one woman wrote. \"I trusted Prigozhin, but what he did is dishonourable.\"\n\n\"He shouldn't have done this. This is pure betrayal,\" agreed another user.\n\nPrigozhin long enjoyed highly vocal support from a network of pro-Wagner influencers. For months, they have championed his actions and attacked his opponents in the Ministry of Defence - particularly his sworn enemy, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nBut when the Wagner mutiny was developing, their reaction was surprisingly muted.\n\nTwo of the largest groups, Grey Zone and Reverse Side of the Medal - with almost 900,000 followers between them - did not rush to endorse his actions, instead aiming for the reasonably neutral middle ground of blaming antagonism by Mr Shoigu and his loyalists for the bloodshed.\n\nFighters of Wagner group stand guard outside the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don, Russia\n\nWagner PMC Briefs is a channel Prigozhin has confirmed as an official page of Wagner and is run by one of his troops. It noted - with eyebrows raised - that when Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the mutiny, he didn't mention anyone by name.\n\n\"[Putin] did not name \"the mutineers and traitors,\" it said. \"Perhaps it was to let Prigozhin restore justice and punish those guilty of real betrayal that resulted in the failure [of Russia's invasion of Ukraine]?\n\nThe theory that Mr Putin and Prigozhin conspired to stage a coup attempt in order to \"test the loyalty of the Russian elites\" quickly gained traction on social media.\"Girls, I thought maybe it was all orchestrated to remove Shoigu, but through Prigozhin, so Putin wouldn't have to do it himself?\" wrote a woman on the Wagner relatives' chat.\n\nVolodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta Center for Applied Political Research in Kyiv, disagrees.\n\n\"If it was staged, what for? So everyone could see how weak Putin is?\" he said. \"What happened was a public humiliation of Putin. And Prigozhin? He partially lost his reputation: He used to demonstrate power, and then he simply retreated.\"\n\nBut Prigozhin's last public comment on the day of the mutiny, filmed after he agreed to stand down, continues to fuel speculation online. \"We've had an OK result today,\" he said. \"Cheered everybody up.\"Kenneth Law has been charged in connection to two deaths in Canada, but police believe there may be more victims\n\nUK police are carrying out checks on addresses where a poisonous substance linked to suicides may have been sent.\n\nIt follows the arrest of a Canadian man accused of \"counselling and aiding suicide\" by distributing the dangerous product worldwide.\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) is working with Canadian authorities to identify potential cases of vulnerable people buying the poison in Britain.\n\nThe substance has been linked to deaths in Canada, the US and the UK.\n\nKenneth Law, 57, was arrested in the Toronto area and is accused of sending 1,200 packages to more than 40 countries.\n\nIt is not known if they all contained the toxic substance.\n\nPolice in Canada say they began investigating the case more than a month ago following the sudden death of an adult in the Toronto area.\n\nDuring that investigation they became aware of a second local death allegedly linked to Mr Law, who is accused of operating several companies offering the substance for sale.\n\nMr Law's arrest comes after a recent investigation by the Times alleged he had links to at least four deaths in the UK.\n\nThe NCA has confirmed that it was contacted by the Canadian authorities via Interpol with details of people who may have used Mr Law's website.\n\nIt has asked forces across the country to carry out welfare visits to addresses which may have received parcels, though it is not clear how many are involved.\n\nDeputy Chief Mark Andrews of Peel Police said his team are working with other forces internationally to see if more charges might be laid.\n\n\"We believe there could be", "CC says that this is ahead of schedule and that the market is \"currently growing well\".\n\nTo meet higher demand, the government wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points by 2030. This represents more than a ten-fold increase from present levels. It has pledged over \u00a3350m to fund charging infrastructure.\n\nIn June 2022, the government announced it was ending grants for electric cars, saying the payment was having \"little effect on rapidly accelerating sales\".\n\nIn March 2022, it pledged \u00a3200m for nearly 1000 new electric and hydrogen buses, and is consulting on an earlier phase-out date of non-zero-emissions buses between 2025 and 2032.\n\nAnd it aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, but the CCC says it needs a clearer plan to achieve this.\n\nIt has promised to double cycling rates from 2013 levels by 2025, and build a \"world-class\" cycling network by 2040. It has spent \u00a3338m on walking and cycling infrastructure in England\n\nFlying makes up about 7% of overall UK emissions, and shipping about 3%.\n\nThe UK published its strategy for delivering net zero aviation by 2050 in July 2022.\n\nIt was criticised for relying too much on technologies such as sustainable fuels and zero emissions aircraft that do not yet exist. It also relies on the development of ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to make up for remaining emissions in 2050.\n\nAs a result, the CCC said that the government should be looking at how to manage demand and not allow it to grow.\n\nThe government has announced \u00a377m of funding to help decarbonise shipping.\n\nAgriculture is the source of 11% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe CCC said emissions from agriculture needed to be cut by 30% between 2019 and 2035.\n\nThis would require eating 20% less meat and dairy by 2030 and shifting land from agriculture to supporting trees and restoring peatlands.\n\nThe CCC criticised the government's food strategy for failing to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace.\n\nThe National Food Strategy independent review shows daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade. The government has been criticised for not pushing for further behavioural change in meat consumption.\n\nIn February 2023, the government released details of its long-awaited environmental land management schemes, replacing the EU common agricultural policy.\n\nTrees and peatlands play important roles in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nUK forest cover is 13%, among the lowest in Europe.\n\nThe government has pledged to end deforestation in the UK by 2030. It has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025.\n\nHowever, annual tree planting has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. In June 2022, the UK forestry body warned that there was \"zero chance\" of the UK meeting its target.\n\nIt is estimated that only around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlands are responsible for 5% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up carbon dioxide.\n\nThe government aims to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland by 2025, and will completely ban the sale of horticultural peat by 2030. However, the CCC warns this does not go far enough.\n\nHydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage.\n\nThe government says it is committed to developing the UK's low carbon hydrogen capabilities and considers it a critical part of energy security and decarbonisation. It wants to have a 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030.\n\nThe industry is in its infancy, and the government admits it will need \"rapid and significant scale-up\" in the coming years.\n\nA recent study warned that hydrogen was less efficient and more expensive for heating homes than alternatives such as heat pumps.\n\nThe government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating by 2026. In March 2023 it announced the first winning projects from the \u00a3240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.\n\nIn December 2022, it launched a consultation on the potential for hydrogen transport.\n\nThe ability to capture carbon before it is released - or take it out of the atmosphere and store it - will be important if the UK is to reach net zero, to balance emissions from the continued limited use of natural gas.\n\nThe government is aiming to capture and store between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.\n\nIn March 2023 it announced the first sites for storing captured carbon, which will be on Teesside.\n\nThe Chancellor recently announced \u00a320bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years. But the technology is still emerging and is expensive.\n\nEmissions from manufacturing and construction represent about 12% of total UK emissions.\n\nThe government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two-thirds by 2035.\n\nIt has awarded \u00a334.8m of funding through the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund to help energy-intensive industries decarbonise, but critics say this is insufficient.\n\nThe government also plans to cap the amount of emissions allowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time.\n\nBut the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries and therefore not reducing their emissions.A major multi-agency search is under way for Ausra Plungiene\n\nA major search is under way for a missing woman who was last seen walking her dog.\n\nAusra Plungiene, 56, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, is believed to have left home to walk her dog at about 10:30 BST on Tuesday.\n\nThe alarm was raised shortly before 22:00 when police began a search across Eryri, also known as Snowdonia.\n\nNorth Wales Police said Ms Plungiene's car was found in Rowen, Conwy, early on Wednesday.\n\nIt is believed to still be parked in the same place, in a car park at Bwlch y ddeufaen.\n\nA car believed to be that of Ausra Plungiene was found in a car park near Rowen, Conwy\n\nOfficers said she may have been wearing a dark pink or purple padded jacket, black leggings and blue shoes.\n\nMs Plungiene left home to walk her dog at about 10:30 BST on Tuesday\n\nSupt Owain Llewellyn said: \"We are extremely concerned for Ausra's safety and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen her or has any information on her whereabouts to get in touch.\n\n\"A number of resources were deployed throughout the night to try and find her.

My son was my heart and my life. And he was stolen from me.

But it was a big one as Sexton thumped a penalty between the sticks to surpass Ronan O'Gara as the competition's record scorer.\n\nWhile Sexton's record-breaking penalty settled a few nerves, Sheehan's score produced a massive roar from the Aviva crowd, the hooker crossing after a well-worked set-piece that saw Josh van der Flier breaking from a line-out maul.\n\nWith Sheehan having given Ireland a much-needed shot in the arm, things went from bad to worse for England on the cusp of half-time when Steward was sent off after colliding with Hugo Keenan.\n\nAfter an Irish pass went forwards, Keenan stooped to pick up the loose ball. The on-rushing Steward turned sideways at the last moment and Keenan's head collided with the England full-back's arm, with referee Jaco Peyper ruling that the contact merited a red card.\n\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, England refused to lie down in the second half, and moved to within a point when Farrell booted his third penalty between the posts.\n\nBut Ireland managed to regain control and exerted enough pressure to prise open holes in the English defence, with Henshaw able to slip through before Sheehan's second score seemingly put the hosts out of England's reach.\n\nTo their credit, England continued to plug away and scored their only try when George crashed over, but after the visitors' Jack Willis was sin-binned, replacement Irish hooker Herring stretched to score his first Six Nations try and complete a famous triumph for Ireland.\n\nWhile England head coach Steve Borthwick can take heart that his side delivered on their promise to show more fight than they did against France, a fourth-place finish is a stark reminder of the task facing Eddie Jones' successor.\n\nIn contrast, Ireland will now approach the World Cup later this year with relish as they look to progress past the quarter-finals of rugby's quadrennial showpiece for the first time.\n\nThat is all to come. For now, Ireland can celebrate retaking their place at the top of the Six Nations.\n\u2022 None Ireland have now won four Grand Slams with triumphs coming in 1948, 2009, 2018 and 2023\n\u2022 None They have won five Six Nations titles with their other wins in 2009, 2014, 2015 and 2018\n\u2022 None Andy Farrell's side set a new national record of eight straight Six Nations wins, surpassing the seven-game streak they set between 2004 and 2005\n\u2022 None Ireland are on a national record run of 14 wins at home\n\nAnalysis - what they said\n\nFormer England captain Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I'm proud of the way England fronted up but they gave away far too many penalties.\n\n\"Their ill-discipline kept giving easy ball to Ireland. A good performance by England but the focus should be on this tremendous Irish side.\n\n\"I just cannot see anyone beating the Irish. They are head and shoulders ahead.\n\n\"This Ireland team have what it takes, not just to win the Six Nations, but the World Cup as well.\"\n\nFormer Ireland number eight Jamie Heaslip on Radio 5 Live: \"It's a great day for the Irish. They are a special group with a different mindset to the past. They are comfortable with being the number one side in the world.\"Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nCole Palmer scored twice deep into stoppage time to complete his hat-trick and earn Chelsea a remarkable win against Manchester United despite having previously given up a two-goal lead.\n\nThe latest winner scored in Premier League history, timed at 100 minutes 39 seconds, stunned United, who led through nine minutes of injury time, and sent Stamford Bridge into delirium.\n\nUnited were ahead with 99 minutes 17 seconds on the clock, the latest a side has ever led in a Premier League match they have gone on to lose.\n\nThe two late strikes capped off a breathless game that started at pace, with Blues captain Conor Gallagher slamming the hosts in front, and barely relented throughout.\n\nInside 20 minutes Palmer doubled the hosts' lead from the spot after Antony fouled Marc Cucurella.\n\nBut Alejandro Garnacho sparked a United comeback when he pounced on Moises Caicedo's poor pass across the back.\n\nBruno Fernandes pulled United level just five minutes later when he headed in Diogo Dalot's cross.\n\nGarnacho scored his second when he headed in an excellent outside-of-boot cross from Antony past goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, with what United thought was the winner.\n\nThat was before a dramatic end to the match saw Chelsea take all three points.\n\nSubstitute Noni Madueke was brought down by Dalot in the area and Palmer stepped up confidently to bring the scores level on 100 minutes.\n\nThen in the 101st minute, Palmer picked the ball up from a short corner and his drilled shot was deflected past United goalkeeper Andre Onana to spark wild scenes in the stadium.\n\nSince signing for Chelsea in the summer for a fee of \u00a342.5m, Palmer has hit the ground running at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe 21-year-old has been the standout player in an inconsistent season for Chelsea and their young squad.\n\nPalmer's hat-trick brings his goal tally to 16 in the league - joint-second and only behind Manchester City's Erling Haaland.\n\nHe has seven goals in his last four games for the club as he continues to be the shining light for Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nHe also has a 100% record from the penalty spot and has scored eight so far this season - such is his quality it did not feel in doubt that he would score both spot-kicks in this match.\n\nHaving made his England debut in November and been included in the most recent squad, on this form he is looking ever more likely to be included by Gareth Southgate for Euro 2024 this summer.\n\nIt's been an inconsistent season for Manchester United and this performance summed up the campaign they are having so far.\n\nThey were pounced on by Chelsea at the beginning of the match, did not seem to have an answer to the Blues' intensity, and were lucky to not be further behind before they started their comeback.\n\nGarnacho's effort was rewarded with a gift when Caicedo played him in for his first and he was the furthest United player forward when he got on the end of Antony's cross to score what looked to be the winning goal.\n\nThere are many questions for manager Erik Ten Hag to answer and the manner of this loss will bring an extra amount of scrutiny.\n\nTen Hag's side faced 81 shots across their three Premier League fixtures in March, another 28 here, and the question as to why they are so easy to create chances against will continue to be asked.\n\nIt is the second time in as many matches that United have not won a Premier League game when leading in stoppage time and this result leaves them 11 points away from an unlikely Champions League place.\n\u2022 None Mois\u00e9s Caicedo (Chelsea) is shown the yellow card for excessive celebration.\n\u2022 None Goal!

This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020.\n\nIt is, however, very hard to judge exactly what these declarations tell us. They are not normally made public and instead are there to alert local health systems that a service needs help. We have nothing to compare them to.\n\nIf we look at the delays ambulances face when dropping off patients at A&E - this data is available in England up to last weekend - we can see the current difficulties are worse than the last winter before the pandemic hit.\n\nBut it is also fair to say this does not represent the collapse of the NHS, despite all the headlines.\n\nThe truth is the health service will not suddenly become overwhelmed. Instead, what is happening is that care is deteriorating bit by bit.\n\nThe heart attack patients are waiting longer for an ambulance, more elderly patients are spending nights on a trolley in A&E and growing numbers of people are waiting for hip and knee replacements.\n\nThe challenges are, of course, different from winters past. It is a pandemic after all.\n\nA mass vaccination campaign is underway, while the level of staff absence from Covid is bringing another added complexity - it is nearly twice what you would expect - and explains why the army has had to be brought in.\n\nHospitals have also had to completely reconfigure their wards to create Covid and non-Covid areas.\n\nAnd the sheer numbers coming in are a problem. Traditionally winter would see around 1,000 admissions a day for all types of respiratory infections.\n\nCurrently the NHS is seeing more than double that for Covid alone - although a chunk admittedly are people who are ill with something else, such as broken arms, strokes and cancer for example, and may well have come in anyway.\n\nBut even if you discount these patients, you are still well above the 1,000 threshold.\n\nHowever, the NHS has been helped by lower pressures elsewhere. Flu is at rock-bottom levels. There are fewer than 50 patients in hospital with the virus in England.\n\nSo what can we conclude? The challenges are certainly worse and that is translating into poorer quality services.\n\nBut this is not the first year care has been compromised. What matters now is when Covid infections peak - that will determine just how bad this winter will be.\n\nHas your NHS treatment been delayed?

We then can discuss the best treatment options for them and provide a choice of treatment.\"\n\nWhile GPs receive some menopause training, many have told BBC News NI it was not enough and they had to refer to the British Menopause Society's tool kit, which was not ideal.\n\nIn February, a consultant addressed the issue of hysterectomies on social media.\n\nDr Siobhan Kirk, associate specialist in gynaecology and menopause posted on Twitter for \"gynaecology colleagues to \"please stop removing young women'", "humanitarian law\". The UK government is also preparing an assessment that will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law in its actions from early 2024.\n\nBut a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was \"not going to happen\".\n\nThe government of Canada, whose arms sales to Israel were worth 21.3m Canadian dollars ($15.7m; \u00a312.4m) in 2022, said in January that it had suspended approving new exit permits for weapons until it could ensure they were being used in accordance with Canadian law. However, pre-existing permits remained valid.\n\nIsrael's Elbit Systems developed the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being used in Gaza\n\nIsrael has also built up its own defence industry with US help and now ranks as the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world, with a focus on advanced technological products rather than large-scale hardware.\n\nIt held a 2.3% share of global sales between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI, with India (37%), the Philippines (12%) and the US (8.7%) the three main recipients. The sales were worth $12.5bn (\u00a39.9bn) in 2022, according to the Israeli defence ministry.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made up 25% of those exports, followed by missiles, rockets and air defence systems (19%) and radar and electronic warfare systems (13%), the ministry said.\n\nIn September, just before the war began, Germany agreed a $3.5bn deal with Israel to buy the sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defence system, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles. The deal - Israel's largest-ever - had to be approved by the US because it jointly developed the system.\n\nThe US has reportedly allowed Israel to draw artillery shells from its reserve stockpile there\n\nIsrael is also home to a vast US arms depot set up in 1984 to pre-position supplies for its troops in case of a regional conflict, as well as to give Israel quick access to weapons in emergencies.\n\nThe Pentagon shipped about 300,000 155mm artillery shells from the War Reserve Stockpile Ammunition-Israel to Ukraine following the Russian invasion.\n\nStockpiled munitions at the depot have also reportedly been supplied to Israel since the start of the Gaza war.Last updated on .From the section Irish\n\nIt was special night with two special goals and Andy Ryan sent the home fans into raptures by curling into the top corner to give Larne a first-half lead.\n\nFallon levelled on 69 minutes with a bending 15-yard strike which also nestled in the top corner.\n\nThe Blues are six points clear in second as they chase a European place.\n\nA win would have sealed second place and European qualification for Linfield and that will be confirmed if Glentoran fail to beat Coleraine on Saturday.\n\nBut it was Larne's night - the title was clinched last week at Seaview but they were at home in front of a packed Inver Park with the presentation of the Gibson Cup after the game.\n\nFuad Sule, Micheal Glynn, Lee Bonis and Ryan sent early efforts off-target as the hosts made a bright start.\n\nBonis saw a shot saved by Chris Johns before the Blues threatened with Joel Cooper arrowing across goal and just wide.\n\nThe opener came on 39 minutes and it was a memorable goal as Ryan moved in from the right before curling the ball over Johns and into the net from 25 yards.\n\nCooper squandered a good chance to level before the break when the winger drilled a low shot straight at keeper Rohan Ferguson.\n\nBonis came so close to giving Larne the perfect start to the second half as the striker's header from a Glynn free-kick crashed against the crossbar.\n\nFallon equalised on 57 minutes with the midfielder moving through unchallenged before unleashing an unstoppable long-range shot beyond Ferguson.\n\nLarne almost regained the lead when Kyle McClean cleared off the line from a Millar header.\n\nAt the other end Sam Roscoe headed wide from a Niall Quinn corner while former Larne captain Jeff Hughes, who retired earlier this year because of injury, came on for the hosts in the dying seconds in an emotional final appearance for his hometown club.Victor Lee died from stab wounds, the Met Police said\n\nThree teenagers have been charged with the murder of 17-year-old Victor Lee, who was found dead in a canal in north-west London last Sunday.\n\nVictor's body was pulled from the Grand Union Canal after police were called to reports of a stabbing.

He had quietly flown back to the UK to make what had clearly been planned as a dramatic entrance.\n\nNo-one had expected him to appear in person for a week of what were billed to be complex legal arguments about whether seven well-known people should be allowed to sue Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail titles.\n\nThe duke's manifesto is clear. As he writes in his book, Spare, \"it's about not letting people get away with abuse, and lies. Especially the kind of lies that can destroy innocents\".\n\nFor several days he sat on the padded seats of court 76 listening to what was said, writing in a black notebook and occasionally passing notes to his lawyers. The actor Sadie Frost sat next to him, another of the seven.\n\nJournalists, a breed the duke appears to loathe, sat yards away, and it became routine to file out of the court for lunch breaks with Prince Harry and his close protection detail joining the hungry queue for the exit.\n\nAlso there at times were Sir Elton John, his husband David Furnish, and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, who, along with Sir Simon Hughes and Elizabeth Hurley, are also claiming breaches of privacy by the newspapers. They seemed prepared to endure the more uncomfortable plastic seats of the court - although Mr Furnish seemed to have more stamina than Sir Elton.\n\nThe allegations are eye-watering. Nineteen private investigators are alleged to have placed phone taps on landlines, taped microphones to windows, bugged cars, intercepted voicemail, blagged information ranging from bank statements to flight details, and put their targets under surveillance. They are said to have worked for around 80 journalists on the two Associated Newspapers titles.\n\nThe publisher denies the allegations, branding the claims \"preposterous smears\".\n\nThe venue was appropriate. Eleven years ago, in the identical court 73 one floor below, Lord Justice Leveson heard months of evidence during his public inquiry into press standards, relevant to the current case in two important ways.\n\nFirst, in front of Lord Justice Leveson, Associated Newspapers repeatedly denied on oath that it had commissioned illegal methods of gathering private information. Second, the inquiry was given records of payments made by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators.\n\nDuring this week's hearings the judge was considering whether the payment records, held confidentially by the Leveson Inquiry, could be used in this case, and whether the whole thing should be thrown out because of a legal time limit.\n\nBarristers for the seven said they had been put off taking legal action because of the vehement denials by the newspapers at the public inquiry. Only recently, they argued, had real evidence come forward.\n\nSir Elton John also attended court earlier in the week\n\nThis case is hugely important because Associated Newspapers has always strongly denied paying for this sort of illegal newsgathering. A decade after law firms began suing rival titles The Sun, News of the World, and Mirror for millions in damages resulting from phone hacking, Associated Newspapers has remained untouched.\n\nThe publisher's reputation is at stake - and its bottom line. News UK, which owns The Sun, has paid an estimated \u00a31bn in damages and legal costs during the hacking cases. Should Associated Newspapers lose this case, sources close to the law firms mounting the legal challenge say there are dozens more famous people waiting to sue.\n\nAssociated Newspapers, represented during the hearings by two \"silks\", or senior barristers, and a row of lawyers frantically scribbling in notebooks or tapping on tablets, has not been shy about proclaiming its innocence.\n\nThe publisher has described the claims as a \"pre", "I don't want to say it, but I think he will be his mum's boy for the rest of his life and I'll take care of him for the rest of his life.\"This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The chancellor said his first Budget will give \"nearly five times more help\" for parents dealing with child care costs.\n\nJeremy Hunt insists his Budget will get young parents and over-50s back into work - and it will not just benefit the rich who are saving for retirement.\n\nThe chancellor told the BBC he wanted to fill a million vacancies across the UK so firms can \"grow faster\".\n\nHe plans to expand free childcare in England and scrap the \u00a31m cap for tax-free pension savings.\n\nLabour has said it will reverse the pension move if elected, calling it a \"tax cut for the top 1%\".\n\nIt was \"the wrong priority, at the wrong time\", said shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. Labour has said it would target the pensions tax cut at NHS doctors if it wins power.\n\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Hunt claimed the UK economy would avoid a recession, with inflation predicted to more than halve by the end of this year.\n\nBut he said a shortage of workers was holding back growth, and he wanted more over-50s, people with disabilities and parents of young children to get back to work.\n\nOffering eligible working parents with children as young as nine months in England 30 hours of free childcare is a key part of the plan - but it will not be introduced fully until September 2025.\n\nMr Hunt said he would like to have extended childcare help sooner but it first needed a big increase in the number of childminders and nurseries.\n\nAs well as scrapping the \u00a31m cap on the amount people can save for their pensions before it is taxed extra, he increased the annual tax-free allowance on pensions from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000.\n\nThe changes aim to encourage senior teachers and doctors to keep working.\n\nAsked about criticism that it was a \"Budget for the rich\", allowing people who are already well off to save more for their pensions, he said: \"Well, of course we want to help older people who want to stay in work.\n\n\"By definition, they will generally be on higher salaries, but nearly five times more help is going to young parents to help them with childcare costs, a nearly 60% reduction in childcare costs of \u00a36,500 a child.\n\n\"That will make a huge difference to families. But also it will make a huge difference to businesses who worry - particularly smaller businesses - that they are losing valuable employees when they start a family.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Tory Budget shows 'just how out of touch they are' - Starmer\n\nThe government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says the chancellor's policies are likely to add about 110,000 people to the UK workforce, depending on how they react to the various incentives.\n\nAsked why after 13 years of a Conservative government a whole generation is not doing as well as their parents had, Mr Hunt said his growth plan meant \"better jobs and better opportunities\".\n\n\"We had half a million people who left the labour force during the lockdowns,\" he added. \"That's an effect you haven't seen in other countries and that's why I've announced the measures I've announced today to encourage people back to work.\"\n\nOne senior government figure described it as \"a steady-as-she-goes Budget\", after the turbulence of Liz Truss's short-lived premiership.\n\nThe OBR said the UK economy would shrink by 0.2% this year, which is better than previously forecast and does not, technically, count as a recession.\n\nInflation is forecast to fall from 10.7% in the final quarter of last year to 2.9% by the end of 2023.\n\nLiving standards are still expected to fall by the largest amount since records began, according to the OBR, but the decline will not be as bad as it had forecast in November.\n\nThe economy is predicted to return to growth - but house prices are projected to fall by 10% by 2025.\n\nThe OBR also highlighted Rishi Sunak's April 2021 decision, when he was chancellor, to freeze tax thresholds, which it said amounted to the equivalent of a 4p increase in the basic rate of income tax.\n\nThat move, dubbed a \"stealth tax\" by critics, is due to come into effect next month and will increase government income by \u00a329.3bn a year.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday morning, Mr Hunt admitted \"for a while the tax burden will be higher\" due to costs incurred during the pandemic and on subsidising energy costs.\n\n\"These things have to be paid for\", he said, adding \"it's the right thing to do to get through this difficult period\". He said the government wants to cut taxes \"when we can\".\n\nPressed on why childcare reforms will take years to roll out, he described the changes as \"the biggest in my lifetime\" and said the sector needs time to adjust to a new surge in demand.\n\nHe also defended the decision to remove the lifetime allowance on pension pots as a measure which will help the NHS retain doctors who otherwise might opt for early retirement or to cut their hours.\n\nLabour's Rachel Reeves said the policy is a tax giveaway for the \"top 1%\" and should have been targeted at the health sector, rather than applied more broadly.\n\nSome Tory MPs were disappointed by the decision to go ahead with a planned rise to corporation tax next month.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt said that businesses would be able to deduct money they invest in IT equipment and machinery from their taxable profits for the next three years.\n\nThere was no announcement in this Budget of extra money for public sector pay, as a wave of strikes by workers including junior doctors, teachers and rail staff continues.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Hunt also pledged an expansion in wraparound care at the start and finish of the school day for parents with older children and changes to staff-to-child ratios in England to expand supply of childcare, although the target date for the measure was September 2026.\n\nAnd he announced plans to abolish Work Capability Assessments, which he said would \"separate benefit entitlement from an individual's ability to work\".\n\nFrom 2026, the government will use another test, currently used to assess eligibility for Personal Independence Payments, the main disability benefit, to decide if someone is eligible for additional payments.\n\nOther measures unveiled in the Budget include:\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"After 13 years of his government, our economy needed major surgery, but like millions across our country, this Budget leaves us stuck in the waiting room with only a sticking plaster to hand.\n\n\"A country set on a path of managed decline, falling behind our competitors, the sick man of Europe once again.\"\n\nSNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie said: \"It's truly pathetic that the chancellor has failed to cut energy bills, despite having ample resources to do so.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak had a chance to show they care about the cost-of-living crisis that's hitting millions of Britain's families and pensioners but they failed miserably.\"\n\nHow has the Budget affected you?

It is not a negotiating ploy,\" the source told the BBC.\n\nA separate source said that Royal Mail is in \"uncharted territory\" in terms of what would happen if it went into administration, but the unprofitable letter delivery part of the business would likely have to be split from the parcel delivery part.\n\nA Royal Mail spokesman said the firm is \"doing all we can\" to resolve the dispute, and that the firm is \"committed to getting the right deal\".\n\nBut he said the firm has been \"very clear about the damaging impact of strike action\".\n\nA CWU spokesman said it was \"clear\" that Royal Mail Group are in a \"serious financial situation\", but that this was due to \"mismanagement and recklessness at the most senior level of the company\".\n\n\"There is no positive future for Royal Mail without the support of the workforce,\" he added.\n\nThe government would have to approve a move into administration.\n\nThis could mean Royal Mail, including Parcelforce, is declared insolvent.\n\nThe dispute is not just over pay. Royal Mail is also trying to make changes to the way postal staff do their jobs including changes to start times and sick pay.\n\nThe long-running dispute has seen workers and management at loggerheads, leading to industrial action including a strike over Christmas, with further possible strikes.\n\nThe company has been beset by recent problems, including the prospect of further strikes, and a cyber attack which disrupted overseas mail.\n\nRoyal Mail has said it is losing \u00a31m a day and that it is projected to lose more than \u00a3350m for the financial year ending in April.\n\nIt has said the strikes have cost the company \u00a3200m in lost business and in covering striking staff.\n\nTalks between the company and the Communications Workers Union (CWU) have been ongoing since the end of last year.\n\nIn the past few days, Sir Brendan Barber, the former head of the TUC and ex-chair of conciliation service Acas, has been brought in to help facilitate the talks.\n\nThere is currently a pay offer of 9% over two years starting in April, including a 2% offer for 2022/23.\n\nThe business says modernisation is essential if the company is to improve its parcel delivery service.\n\nThe firm has been trying to move away from letter delivery, which it has said is unprofitable, but it is obliged to deliver letters to all parts of the UK.\n\nThe CWU has previously said that Royal Mail's management was trying to \"casualise\" the postal service and that they \"want to turn it into an Uber-style employer\".Declan Donnelly and Ant McPartlin - disconcertingly the wrong way round - found fame as PJ and Duncan on Byker Grove\n\nTV series Byker Grove is to make a comeback - produced by former stars Ant and Dec.\n\nThe children's series - set in Newcastle - aired on the BBC from 1989 to 2006 and focused on the lives of youngsters who attended the youth club of the same name.\n\nIt saw Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly find fame as PJ and Duncan.\n\nThe pair, who will be executive producers on the reboot, said they were \"beyond excited\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

I thought it was good to get involved because of the concern about lots of sports having problems with concussion\".\n", "a \"cry for help\" over staffing levels.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid pandemic in 2020, many older air traffic controllers retired, and have yet to be replaced, he said.\n\nHe said he expected this potential dispute to be resolved before it reached the stage of a strike.\n\nBut a more pressing concern was a lack of air traffic controllers in general, with impacts already being felt through \"a series of cancellations every day in the UK\".\n\nThis comes as demand for air travel rebounds after the pandemic, he added, with Friday being the busiest day for air travel since 2019.\n\nLast summer, holidaymakers were affected by sustained disruption to flights due to staff shortages, and across 2022 as a whole more than a third of UK flights were delayed.\n\nHaving axed thousands of jobs during the worst of the Covid pandemic, many aviation businesses including airports could not get new staff in place quickly enough.\n\nBut at Easter this year, airports and airlines told the BBC they were confident they had enough staff to avoid any travel chaos.\n\nThis summer, having raised staffing levels, disruption instead could come from industrial action.\n\nTravel to France from the UK has already been affected this year by some strikes.Fourth LV= Insurance Ashes Test, Emirates Old Trafford (day four of five):\n\nEngland dodged the rain to take the vital wicket of Marnus Labuschagne but their Ashes hopes remain in the balance going into the final day of the fourth Test against Australia.\n\nOn a fourth day that could have been entirely lost to rain, a period of dry weather allowed 30 overs of play from 14:45 BST at Old Trafford.\n\nEngland were frustrated for a long period by Labuschagne, who made only his second overseas Test hundred and shared a stubborn partnership of 103 with Mitchell Marsh.\n\nAs the light faded, England were ordered to bowl spin and Joe Root's off-breaks provided an unlikely source of inspiration.\n\nHe had Labuschagne caught behind by juggling wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow for 111 and almost had Marsh held at short leg.\n\nRain arrived at the scheduled tea break of 17:00, preventing any further action and leaving Australia on 214-5, still 61 short of making England bat again. Marsh has 31 and Cameron Green three.\n\nWith more bad weather forecast for Sunday, England are left hoping for enough time to force the win that would level the series at 2-2 and turn the fifth Test at The Oval into a decider.\n\nThough victory is now almost out of the question for Australia, a draw would be enough for them to retain the urn.\n\u2022 None How day four at Old Trafford unfolded\n\u2022 None England will win 3-2 if they win fourth Test - Vaughan\n\nThis series has produced three thrilling Tests, with the drama in the fourth now coming through England's battle with the weather. It would be a huge anti-climax if the rain has a decisive say in the destination of the Ashes urn.\n\nEngland were fortunate to get any play on Saturday. Overnight rain persisted into the morning and early afternoon, but the ground was readied at a remarkable speed. The empty stands filled rapidly as news of a start filtered through.\n\nThough the overheads were ideal and the crowd expectant, England were blocked by an unresponsive surface - there was no sign of the uneven bounce from earlier in the match - and the determination of Labuschagne and Marsh.\n\nThe reverse swing of Friday evening also disappeared as the ball became wet. When England persuaded the umpires to change it and looked to bring Mark Wood into the attack, they were told the light was not fit enough for pace. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as Root proved to be the most threatening bowler.\n\nEngland will return on Sunday wishing for the weather to be kind. There is the possibility of 98 overs of play and second new ball available nine overs into the day.\n\nFor Australia, they will not only be looking to repel England, but also build a lead to make the hosts' route to victory longer. Their inclusion of both Marsh and Green in this Test, extending the batting line-up, was done partly with this scenario in mind.\n\nLabuschagne delivers when Australia need it most\n\nThis has been a difficult series for Labuschagne. Beginning ranked as the world's number one Test batter, he had not managed a half-century before this match.\n\nHe hinted at a return to form with 51 in the first innings and then delivered what could yet prove to be an Ashes-saving hundred.\n\nWith Australia 113-4 overnight, Labuschagne began on 44 and Marsh one. Though Labuschagne took a painful blow on the finger from a Wood bouncer, he was largely untroubled by England's short-ball plan.\n\nMarsh, usually so aggressive, was a calm foil. He has struck only four fours in a 107-ball stay and two of those came in successive deliveries from Chris Woakes, who spent time off the field suffering from stiffness.\n\nWhen Root came on, Labuschagne lofted two sixes over long-on, but also flashed an edge off an arm-ball past slip Zak Crawley when he was on 93.\n\nHe went to his 11th Test ton by pinching a single off Moeen Ali before making an error attempting to cut Root and was given out on review.\n\nGiven the stakes and urgency of the situation, this was a curiously flat performance from England's seamers.\n\nThey got little movement from the ball or the pitch and chewed up precious time as they deliberated over field placings and tactics.\n\nA bouncer plan achieved little other than knocking the ball out of shape, after which came the stroke of luck with Wood being denied the chance to bowl, resulting in the call to Moeen and Root.\n\nWhile Moeen mixed some dangerous bounce with regular loose deliveries, Root constantly made things happen.\n\nHe was convinced on-field umpire Nitin Menon had made a mistake for the Labuschagne wicket, celebrating towards the Party Stand even before the review was complete. In the same over, an inside edge off Marsh went in and out of the fingers of bat-pad fielder Harry Brook.\n\nGreen survived a review off Moeen from the final ball before the tea break. England would have been happy to bowl more spin after the interval, only to be denied the opportunity.\n\nAustralia batter Marnus Labuschagne, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always very special getting a Test hundred. It doesn't happen too often but I'm disappointed I couldn't get us to tea.\n\n\"We were so close to having a tremendous day there. For us, this is about saving this Test match and retaining the Ashes.\"\n\nEngland batting coach Marcus Trescothick: \"We got more play than we expected. It looked like a complete washout so it's a bonus. We're one wicket closer but it's still frustrating.\n\n\"It really does depend on the weather. We wanted to get two or three wickets today and we'll take any play we can tomorrow.\"\n\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: \"England were a bit flat. There wasn't much of their usual chatter and the noise from the players you get when you are going for a win.\"Ch Supt Richard North said they are \"using all resources available to us\" to investigate the attack\n\nCounter-terror police are involved in an investigation into a man being set alight as he walked home from a mosque.\n\nA man has been held on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on Monday.\n\nThe West Midlands and Metropolitan forces are looking into whether there is a link to a similar attack in Ealing, west London last month.\n\nThe Birmingham victim, in his 70s, was approached, sprayed with a substance and had his jacket set on fire.\n\nNeighbours told the BBC they helped to put the flames out and carry the victim to his home where he was treated by paramedics.\n\nHis son said his father was \"very badly burned\" and they were praying for his recovery.\n\nHe was taken to hospital with burns to his face which are serious but not thought to be life-threatening. Police said he remained in a stable condition.\n\nTayyab Riaz, the victim's nephew, said everyone was \"very upset\" at the \"shocking news\".\n\n\"For 35 years he's been going to that mosque to pray and there's never", "overhaul.\n\nThe complex project saw most of the 200-year-old Union Chain Bridge removed and restored, then put back in place.\n\nThe work fell behind schedule due to a \"range of challenges\" but has now been completed.\n\nThe bridge - which first opened in 1820 - crosses the river from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.\n\nThe reopening completes a long journey for the historic structure and brings to an end a 10-mile detour for local traffic.\n\nA piper led the first crossing of the newly reopened bridge\n\nA campaign was launched in 2012 to restore the bridge due to concerns over its condition.\n\nIt had been shut for almost a year in 2007 due to structural problems.\n\nBy 2017, it was hoped that it would cost \u00a35.6m to upgrade the bridge in time to reopen in 2020.\n\nHowever, the price steadily increased to more than \u00a310m and it slipped behind the original timetable.\n\nMartha Andrews said the bridge brought communities on both sides of the border together\n\nMartha Andrews, a trustee of the Friends of the Union Chain Bridge, was among those delighted be able to cross the bridge once more.\n\n\"It is absolutely amazing to see the bridge open today, we have waited so long for this, we have campaigned so hard,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't realise how much you use it until it's not there so for the past two years we have being going round by Norham or round by Berwick instead of straight across the border, straight across the Tweed.\n\n\"It really brings the two communities together.\n\n\"We're going to be using it again and we are going to be using it every day and you'd be surprised if you stood here just how many cars go across it.\"\n\nThe bridge was the longest iron suspension bridge in the world when first opened\n\nThe Union Chain Bridge was built by retired naval captain Samuel Brown and completed in 1820.\n\nIt cost about \u00a37,700 to construct and replaced a \"perilous ford\" slightly downstream.\n\nAlthough work on Thomas Telford's Menai Bridge had started earlier, the Union Bridge was completed first - making it the longest iron suspension bridge in the world when it opened.\n\nHundreds of spectators, including civil engineers Robert Stevenson and John Rennie, turned out to see it open on 26 July.\n\nUntil the 1970s it existed with little maintenance, but the entire deck was replaced in 1974.\n\nThe bridge did not receive any major attention until structural issues started to emerge in recent years, leading to the \u00a310.5m overhaul.\n\nThe overhaul has taken two-and-a-half years to complete\n\nThe restoration work began once a full funding package was in place in October 2020 in the hope that it would take about 15 months to complete.\n\nCovid and the complexity of the project meant that it has taken about a year longer than was first intended.\n\nIts completion means that pedestrians, cyclists and cars can once again cross from one country into another.\n\nAs well as securing the long-term future of the bridge, it is hoped that the structure can become an important visitor attraction.\n\nCouncils on both sides of the border and the National Lottery Heritage Fund helped fund the restoration.\n\nJoe DiMauro of the Spencer Group said it had been a special project to work on\n\nJoe DiMauro - engineering director of the Spencer Group, which worked on the scheme - said it had been a special project.\n\n\"It is a real honour to have been able to work on a 200-year-old suspension bridge like this,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not every day you get the chance to use your engineering judgement to come up with methodologies and sequences to be able to take down, refurbish and rebuild something like this.\n\n\"There are not many of these structures around in the world so having the opportunity to work on this is a privilege.\"\n\nNorthumberland County Council leader Glen Sanderson described it as a \"fabulous moment\" for everyone involved in a \"hugely technical project\".\n\n\"This bridge stands as a testament to partnership working and shows what can be achieved when everyone is pulling in the same direction,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a glorious structure and I'm sure will be a huge draw to tourists as well as providing a much-needed day-to-day connection for local communities on both sides of the border.\"\n\nJohn Greenwell, of Scottish Borders Council, said \"years of hard work\" had gone into making the restoration possible.\n\n\"It's a symbolic link between England and Scotland which has now been protected for many generations to come and I am sure all those involved will feel an incredible sense of pride that this day has come,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.A Sinn F\u00e9in MP has told an IRA commemoration that everyone has \"the right to remember, and the right to commemorate\".\n\nJohn Finucane was the main speaker at what has been billed a \"South Armagh Volunteers commemoration\".\n\nHe said there was \"nothing to celebrate in conflict\", but commemoration was \"a right which everyone is entitled to\".\n\nHis involvement in the event was condemned by IRA victims, unionists and the Irish government.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said Mr Finucane was \"a hypocrite\" for taking part.\n\nMr Finucane told the event that truth and justice were \"something which every person who has been impacted by our conflict deserves.\"\n\n\"For just as truth and justice applies equally to everyone, so too does the right to remember, and the right to commemorate,\" he said.\n\nMr Finucane's father, solicitor Pat Finucane, was shot dead by loyalist gunmen at his home in Belfast in 1989.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MP said he would defend commemorations by other groups - including loyalists - \"without hesitation\".\n\n\"There is nothing to celebrate in conflict, or in our difficult and painful past, but to commemorate those we have loved and lost is a right which everyone, including every single one of us gathered here today, is entitled to, and we do so with dignity and with pride,\" he said.\n\nThe event was held earlier in south Armagh\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Belfast East MP Mr Robinson said Mr Finucane had a few hours to decide if he wanted to \"proceed with being a hypocrite on these issues or withdraw\".\n\n\"You cannot burnish your credentials as a victim one day and then tarnish the memory of victims and their loved ones the next,\" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.\n\nBut Mr Robinson, the newly-elected deputy leader of the DUP said victims were \"hurt\" by the prospect of Mr Finucane's attendance at the event in Mullaghbawn.\n\n\"This should not be happening,\" he said.\n\n\"When we consider the need to reconcile our communities that anybody, let alone a member of Parliament and a victim, would go to a family fun day to show respect for terrorists, shows just how shallow some of the commitments about an Ireland for all are, that have been shared with us over the previous number of weeks.\"\n\nGavin Robinson said victims of terrorism were \"hurt\" at the move\n\nOn Friday, a relative of one of the victims of an IRA bomb atrocity in Coleraine nearly 50 years ago criticised Mr Finucane's planned appearance.\n\nLesley Magee's grandmother, Nan Davis, was among six Protestants killed in the Coleraine attack on 12 June 1973.\n\n\"I don't think we should be commemorating terrorism on any level, whether it be Protestant, whether it be Catholic,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"I have equal animosity towards both. I have no issue with anyone's religion, whether it be Protestant, Catholic, Judaism - whatever; I don't care.\n\n\"I don't think any MP should be at some kind of commemoration to celebrate a terrorist,\" she added.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member Sorcha Eastwood said she was disappointed Mr Finucane took part in the event.\n\n\"There is a difference between remembering and paying tribute to individuals, and commemorating terrorist organisations, including the IRA and its South Armagh 'brigade', particularly without reference to its many victims,\" she said.\n\nU", "a quick scroll on TikTok and you'll see cowboy hats and feather boas as the uniform for Beyonc\u00e9 and Harry Styles concerts.\n\nJess Potter, 36, from Cardiff, will be going to Glastonbury with her online second-hand clothing business.\n\nAt the festival she will be hosting the second-hand style awards, where festival-goers will be judged on their best sustainable looks from the weekend.\n\nJess confesses she has not always been sustainable. During her first Glastonbury in 2014 she bought everything new, she used to be a \"retail addict\". That's where she met her now husband and business partner Davey, and they are now \"on a journey to sustainability together\".\n\nThe idea for UsedandLoved.com - a search engine tool that allows you to search for second-hand items all under one roof - came from a sleepless night idea, said Jess.\n\nJess Potter working on her stall, which will be in the Green Futures area of the festival\n\nShe said second-hand shopping was \"all about finding your own style\", and seeing content creators styling the outfits was key to changing people's attitudes on buying them.\n\nIn her spare time, Jess goes around Cardiff picking up bags of clothes that are left on the side of the road, which she sifts through and gives a new lease of life.\n\n\"I've found stuff from Ralph Lauren and Zara in them, all in really good condition,\" she said.\n\nShe plans to put the clothes found on the streets of Cardiff on display at Glastonbury with the idea that \"they are free again and their destiny has been changed because they are going to get another life, and that clothes can live on for so long if you let them\".\n\nBethany Lewis, from Swansea, planned her whole festival wardrobe via second hand shops and went on online clothes site Vinted for the In It Together festival in Margam, Neath Port Talbot.\n\nWhen she booked for In It Together, she was adamant she would not buy anything new.\n\nBethany Lewis didn't buy anything new for the In It Together festival she attended last month\n\n\"I've never done a festival in that kind of heat before so I kind of took all the basics out of my wardrobe, so I mostly managed to use things I already owned,\" she said.\n\n\"But then, if I was looking for something specific, like I wanted like a mesh top to wear under an outfit so I went on Vinted, looking for stuff specifically.\n\n\"Rather than buying it new, I knew that I got it cheaper. I was also reducing my impact on the environment by buying it.\"\n\nCost plays a part too, with tickets for festivals not cheap.\n\nA ticket to Glastonbury would set you back \u00a3335 this year - and that's without buying your camping essentials like tent, wellies and booze (if that's your thing) - so many people try to use second-hand sites to get their outfits.\n\nCaitlin Smith, a fashion blogger from Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, who's based in London, said: \"I don't tend to buy anything that doesn't work with at least five pieces in my wardrobe. So, if I'm looking for a festival 'fit, I'll only buy items that I know I'll wear again.\n\n\"I blame being a Capricorn for my frugality, so I don't like feeling like I've wasted money on something I'll wear once.\"\n\nCaitlin Smith says Vinted is her \"one true love\"\n\n\"I also tend to look for accessories or builder pieces that I can layer over things I already own. Accessorising and layering are such fun and easy ways to change up your look without having to buy a completely 'new' outfit.\"\n\nRachel Cosgrove-Pearce, the head of retail operations for Oxfam, said shopping second-hand was a great way to express individuality.\n\n\"For the festival season, a lot of the (Oxfam) shops will pull together festival-style windows to help people choose their outfits for going. They'll have festival displays inside and the beauty of shopping second-hand with Oxfam is that you can be your own stylist.\"\n\n\"You can go in, you shop in a variety of brands, you're not being influenced around the latest trends, and you can literally go and choose the pieces and create your own look unique for you.\n\n\"Everyone is more conscious than ever now about sustainability and by shopping with Oxfam not only are you going to look fabulous, and you know you're going to feel fabulous.\"\n\nSo that's the fashion advice. But what to do about the weather?\n\nWith Glastonbury predicted to be a scorcher, the advice is to try and pack for the heat - and if it does rain, trusty wellies and a raincoat will always be in style.A serving member of the UK's armed forces shared \"highly sensitive\" military information, a court was told.\n\nThomas Newsome, 36, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday charged with two offences under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nHe was deployed overseas until April 17, when prosecutors allege he made a \"damaging disclosure of information relating to defence\".\n\nIt follows an investigation by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command.\n\nMr Newsome is also accused of possessing documents \"which he failed to take such care of as to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of those documents as a person in his position may reasonably be expected to take\", on April 18.\n\nHe confirmed his name and date of birth, but his address and the names of his lawyers were withheld on national security grounds.\n\nMr Newsome is alleged to have shared a 10-page document with two senior officers who had clearance to view it, and a civilian who did not. He allegedly took photographs of the document and sent them by social media.\n\nProsecutor Brigid Fitzpatrick said the document, which Newsome allegedly had digital and hard copies of, contained \"highly sensitive military information\".\n\nShe alleged that if it were leaked it would pose a \"real and immediate threat to the lives of British citizens outside the UK\" and \"facilitate the targeting of personnel\".\n\nMr Newsome is also accused of possessing separate secret information on a USB stick.\n\nHe was not granted bail, and will next appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 28 April.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said Mr Newsome was charged on Friday with offences contrary to section 2 and section 8 of the Official Secrets Act.\n\nHe was initially arrested on Tuesday and detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson confirmed the arrest of a serving member of the armed forces, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further.\n\u2022 None What is the Official Secrets Act?Bebe Rexha has yet to comment on the incident\n\nPop star Bebe Rexha was rushed off stage during a concert on Sunday after being hit in the head by a phone thrown by a fan.\n\nThe star, who was performing in New York, collapsed to her knees when the projectile struck the side of her head.\n\nShe was later escorted from the venue, apparently still in pain, with her hands pressed to her face.\n\nVideo posted online showed a man being removed from the crowd by security as fans shouted \"that's assault\".\n\nNew York Police later confirmed that a 27-year-old concertgoer had been charged with assault.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

That changed on Monday afternoon, though, when the suspect's name was revealed as Andrew Lester.\n\nAt the same time, Clay County prosecutor Zachary Thompson announced that Lester had been charged with two crimes: assault in the first degree and armed criminal action.\n\nA prosecutor said there was a \"racial component\" to the shooting but Lester has not been charged with a hate crime, and charging documents do not describe the alleged racial bias.\n\nLester, 84, claims he thought someone was trying to break into his home Image caption: Lester, 84, claims he thought someone was trying to break into his home\n\nLester, 84, lives at an address on 115th Street in Kansas City, Missouri, which is where Ralph mistakenly went last Thursday night to pick up his siblings - who were in fact at an address on nearby 115th Terrace.\n\nYarl's family and legal team claim the boy rang Lester's doorbell twice before the homeowner opened fire with a .32 revolver.

Rupert Murdoch: \"This is the most humble day of my life\"\n\nThe man who has had such a hold over Britain's media since he arrived in London in the late 1960s to buy the News of the World was forced into that humiliating one-liner.\n\n\"This is the most humble day of my life,\" he told MPs (with the theatre of the event heightened by his then wife Wendi Deng later launching herself at a protester who attacked her husband with a custard pie).\n\nNow Murdoch has been forced into another humiliating climbdown, this time in relation to his US operations.\n\nYet again, it's the Murdoch empire's approach to truth that is in the spotlight.\n\nFox News argued it was fighting a court case against voting machine company Dominion in the interests of free speech, a US First Amendment right.\n\nInstead, it appeared that the network relegated fact-based journalism for fiction in the wake of America's 2020 presidential election.\n\nSome of Fox News' most prominent personalities had been expected to testify in the Dominion lawsuit trial\n\nWe already know, from Fox News emails and messages published in February as part of the legal case, that many Fox executives and presenters didn't believe claims of voter fraud - but broadcast them anyway.\n\nThe network carried on giving a platform to people endorsing the views of Donald Trump and his supporters that the election had been stolen - in part, it seems, because it didn't want to upset its viewers.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, pictured at the NRA annual meeting last week, repeatedly claimed the 2020 election was stolen\n\nSuzanne Scott, the Fox News Media chief executive, told Murdoch just before rioters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021 that the channel needed to be careful about \"pissing off the viewers\".\n\nWith 7,000 documents now in the public domain, there has already been a lot of damaging material to chew over. Huge questions remain over the impact Fox News and its broadcasts had over the divisions apparently tearing the US apart. Truth took a back seat and the impact is still being felt.\n\nPerhaps, for Murdoch, the final straw was the prospect of facing another public humiliation, this time in court. Fox's lawyers had failed to persuade the judge that he shouldn't be called to the stand.\n\nAlong with his son Lachlan, Fox Corporation's executive chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch would have had to give evidence.\n\nRupert Murdoch and and his son Lachlan were both expected to give evidence in the trial\n\nAnd it's clear Dominion's lawyers would not have settled for a one-liner from the media mogul.\n\n\"The most humble day of my life\" simply wouldn't have cut it. It would have been hugely embarrassing.\n\nAlthough the case never reached trial and the Murdochs never took the stand, reputationally the damage surely equals that of the hacking scandal.\n\nSo where does this leave the man who has been integral to the fabric of the media landscape in the UK, the US and Australia for so long?\n\nRuthlessness and risk-taking built the Murdoch empire, whether that was his victory over the print unions in the early days of his ownership of the Times and Sunday Times, or his determination to create the right-wing Fox News, credited with helping get Trump elected in 2016.\n\nRupert Murdoch pictured with Donald Trump in 2016, before the US election that saw Trump become president\n\nHis critics will be crowing over the Dominion settlement.\n\nOn CNN, presenter Jake Tapper (who said it was difficult to report the outcome \"with a straight face\") called it \"one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism\".\n\nAnd this isn't the end of the matter. Another voting software company, Smartmatic, is also suing Fox over its broadcasts about voter fraud. It could be even more costly. Smartmatic wants more than Dominion - $2.7bn (\u00a32.2bn) in defamation damages.\n\nIn the UK, the Murdoch empire has already paid out many millions in damages to people who accused it of phone hacking.\n\nPrince Harry is trying to take Murdoch's News Group Newspapers to court over alleged phone hacking\n\nPrince Harry is part of a group of claimants trying to take Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, which includes the Sun, to court over alleged phone hacking.\n\nHow damaging will all this be?\n\nThe $787.5m payout to Dominion is a huge amount. But Fox's revenue in the last quarter of 2022, for example, was $4.6bn (\u00a33.7bn) - and the share price has barely moved in light of the settlement.\n\nPerhaps there's a lesson to learn from 2011. At the time, the horrific story of the News of the World's exploitation of Millie Dowler's murder felt to many like a watershed.\n\nThe News of the World newspaper printed its final edition in 2011\n\nIt cost the empire dearly in the short term - but, while the phone hacking fallout and financial outlay are ongoing, Murdoch's influence has only spread since then.\n\nHe's older now, at 92. He has also suffered a more personal embarrassment recently. Having announced a new engagement and his plans to spend the \"second half of our lives together\", just a few weeks later the marriage plans were off.\n\nBut if we've learned one thing over the past half a century, it's that you underestimate Rupert Murdoch at your peril.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man who shot dead seven people in Germany was visited by police last month after a tip-off raised concerns about his mental health.\n\nHe co-operated with officers and there were not enough grounds to take away his gun at the time, police said.\n\nThe 35-year-old suspect, named only as Philipp F, had a licence to own the weapon for sporting purposes.\n\nThe country is preparing a new law involving tighter curbs on gun ownership, the interior minister said.\n\nSeven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in Thursday's attack which unfolded at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the city.\n\nThe first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) to report that shots had been fired, and officers were on site four minutes later.\n\nVideo appeared to show the gunman firing through a window.

It now says GDP - the value of the goods and services the country produces - fell by 0.1%, compared with its previous estimate of a 0.2% fall.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the figures \"show there's underlying resilience in the UK economy\".\n\nHowever, he added that \"families up and down the country are facing real pressure\".\n\nA recession is usually defined as when the economy contracts for two three-month periods in a row, so the growth at the end of 2022 means the UK avoided one.\n\nLast week, the Bank of England said that the economy was expected to grow only slightly in the coming months.\n\nHowever, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said he was \"much more hopeful\" for the economy, and it was no longer heading into an immediate recession.\n\nMr Bailey's comments came after the Bank increased interest rates to 4.25% from 4%.\n\nInterest rates have been repeatedly hiked as the Bank attempts to get the soaring pace of price rises under control.\n\nInflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, remains close to its highest level for 40 years, and hit 10.4% in the year to February.\n\nRuth Gregory of Capital Economics said the revised ONS figures showed that high inflation took a slightly smaller toll on the economy than thought.\n\nHowever, she said most", "\nThe ECB stated Yorkshire \"failed to take adequate action\" on complaints of racist abuse against crowd members from fellow spectators during a match at Headingley in 2017 and at Scarborough in 2018.\n\nYorkshire were also accused of failing to address the \"systemic use of racist or discriminatory language over a long period\" by employees or players at the club.\n\u2022 None Was it a mistake to sell off British Gas?

which brought the Scottish Greens into government in a historic power-sharing deal with the SNP - ministers had planned to designate at least 10% of Scotland's seas as HPMAs by 2026.\n\nIt meant that all forms of fishing including recreational catch and release angling would be prohibited in selected sites.\n\nSeaweed harvesting would also be banned, no new marine renewable energy schemes would be allowed and the laying of subsea cables would be restricted.\n\nManaged levels of swimming, snorkelling and windsurfing would be allowed.\n\nAbout 37% of Scotland's seas are already included in Scotland's Marine Protected Areas network.\n\nThese areas are managed for the long-term conservation of marine resources, ecosystems services, or cultural heritage.\n\nScottish Conservative rural affairs spokeswoman Rachael Hamilton said: \"The SNP might have rebranded their reckless plans on Highly Protected Marine Areas, but in reality this amounts to little more than kicking the can down the road.\n\n\"Never have I experienced a policy that has received such overwhelming opposition from coastal communities, and Scotland's fishermen must now be at the heart of any proposals brought forward.\n\n\"SNP-Green ministers have caused huge stress in recent months in our coastal communities -

The warning lights are flashing. The alarms are wailing.\n\nBaroness Casey says the Metropolitan Police was expecting a report highlighting the things it needed to look at - but that, overall, the force thought she would say it's doing a good job.\n\n\"It's the exact opposite,\" she says.\n\nBaroness Casey has a reputation for no-nonsense reports. When Dame Cressida Dick, the former Scotland Yard Commissioner, asked her to review the Met, she must have known what she would get.\n\nNot the measured, dispassionate and legalistic volumes most institutional inquiries deliver.\n\nHer language is often emotional and uncompromising, a style that appeals to journalists and politicians looking for a headline.\n\nThis report is so ferocious in its criticism that, in the short term, it is almost certain that trust and confidence levels in the police in London - already down - will plummet further.\n\nWith forces across England and Wales, like the Met, re-vetting all their officers, more scandals will emerge.\n\nEvery misconduct hearing, every court case, is going to damage public confidence.\n\nAccused of institutional prejudice, it seems unlikely that, in the short term at least, this report is going to make it easier to recruit women, or those from the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minorities.\n\nMorale is not going to be improved by a report that is so merciless in its criticism of the Met and its culture.\n\nA generation after the Macpherson report found the Metropolitan Police to be institutionally racist, here we are again. Only worse. Sexism and homophobia are added to the list.\n\nThe report notes that in 1972, on his appointment as commissioner of the force, Sir Robert Mark said he had \"never experienced\u2026blindness, arrogance and prejudice on anything like the scale accepted as routine in the Met\".\n\nThe report immediately adds that the Met is a very different organisation today.

Politicians are suggesting they will want to see results within two years.\n\nBut with a general election likely next year, and manifestos being written even sooner, will politicians show the patience Sir Mark Rowley, the current incumbent in Scotland Yard, says he requires? Especially if more bad headlines see public anxiety increase still further.\n\nBaroness Casey hints at breaking up the Met, if things don't improve. But that kind of major reform of policing feels some way off.\n\nAs things stand, there is no blueprint for a reorganised system in England and Wales - and politicians of all stripes seem content to give Sir Mark the benefit of the doubt for the moment.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has said she will be \"holding the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London to account by measuring progress\", but adds that she currently has \"every confidence that Sir Mark Rowley and his team will deliver\".\n\nSuella Braverman delivering a statement on the Casey report to the Commons on Tuesday\n\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has pointed out that a collapse in trust in the Royal Ulster Constabulary among some communities in Northern Ireland resulted in the successful creation of a new police service, the PSNI.\n\nIs that a hint that a Labour government might institute more radical reform?\n\nParty insiders suggest they will be more hands-on than the current government has been in demanding progress, but there are no plans for systemic change - for now.\n\nWhat does progress look like? Public confidence figures must improve. Recruitment from minorities must increase. Corrupt officers must be identified and booted out. Vetting must be more effective.

'Unite behind us and we can defeat the SNP' - Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross\n\nThe Conservative party has rejected a suggestion from its leader in Scotland that voters could tactically back Labour to oust the SNP.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Douglas Ross said \"where there is the strongest candidate to beat the SNP, you get behind that candidate.\"\n\nIt would be a case of parties doing \"what's best for the country\", he said.\n\n\"This is emphatically not the view of the Conservative Party,\" a Tory spokesperson said.\n\n\"We want people to vote for Conservative candidates wherever they are standing as that's the best way to keep Labour and the SNP out.\"\n\nIn most of the SNP's constituencies, that would actually mean voting Labour or Liberal Democrat.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Ross said: \"The public know how to tactically vote in Scotland...\n\n\"I will always encourage Scottish Conservative voters to vote Scottish Conservatives.\n\n\"But I think generally the public can see, and they want the parties to accept, that where there is a strongest candidate to beat the SNP, you get behind that candidate.\n\n\"If parties maybe look a bit beyond their own narrow party agenda to what's best for the country - and for me as Scottish Conservative leader, what would be best is if we see this grip that the SNP have on Scotland at the moment is loosened.\"\n\nBut later on Sunday, Mr Ross sought to clarify his position, insisting this did not mean encouraging Conservative voters to vote for other parties.\n\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"I urge every Scottish Conservative voter to vote Scottish Conservative and I would always do that.\n\n\"But we also know that in many parts of the country, the Scottish Conservatives are the biggest challengers to the SNP so if supporters of other parties unite behind the Scottish Conservative candidate, we have the best possible chance of defeating many SNP MPs.\n\n\"That will clearly send a message that the public want our politics in Scotland focused on their real priorities - not a divisive independence referendum.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is up to other party leaders to suggest what they are doing in the seats they are targeting.\n\n\"If the supporters of other parties unite behind us we can defeat the SNP and get a result similar or better than what happened in 2017 when the SNP lost a significant number of MPs.\"\n\nLabour's Jackie Baillie said voting for Labour would be all they would ask people to do\n\nWhile local council elections are taking place across much of England and Northern Ireland in May, no seats are up for grabs in Scotland or Wales.\n\nThe next general election must take place on or before 28 January 2025, but it is widely expected that one will", "talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices. Sometimes they ran on beyond midnight. They knew the outcome of their work would be vitally important for the whole NHS in England.\n\nSteve Barclay was present for much of the process, as was health minister Will Quince - though he had to take his leave one day because the King was visiting his constituency.\n\nAccording to one union source: \"Steve Barclay was constructive and there was not the heated atmosphere seen before Christmas.\"\n\nOne government source describes the secretary of state's style: \"What gets him going is seeing a problem through - like a maths problem - he doesn't make a big noise and gets his head down.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay was \"constructive\" in talks, a union source said\n\nThere were tensions at times, but no serious fallings out. Late on Wednesday evening a deal was done. Exhausted participants retired, relieved but knowing it had to be sold to members.\n\nRachel Harrison of the GMB reflects on the outcome: \"They were very long days locked on the ninth floor but it was what we asked for - we wanted to be invited in and they did.\"\n\nUnions had insisted before entering the talks that it had to be \"new money\" which funded any pay offer. Ministers, after the deal, said the funding would not come from NHS frontline budgets.\n\nBut there is still ambiguity about the source of the money, with government sources saying some would come from existing planned Department of Health and Social Care spending and the rest after negotiation with the Treasury.\n\nThe pay dispute started with ministers insisting that they would follow recommendations of the pay review body and not negotiate directly with unions. But it was face-to-face talks which broke the deadlock.\n\nThe deal - a one off payment and a 5% pay rise for the year starting in April - included an agreement to review the composition and remit of the PRB.\n\nYet this is not the end of the process.

So when they are stranded they can crush themselves to death.\n\n\"Pilot whales don't usually come in to shore. They would be potentially disoriented, distressed from what has led to the stranding, and distressed from the stranding itself and being surrounded by family members who have died around them.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest incidents we've had in the last couple of decades.\"\n\nA Comhairle spokesperson said: \"Comhairle nan Eilean Siar asks that the public follow police advice and avoid Traigh Mh\u00f2r.\n\n\"The Comhairle has engaged with professionals and is now working with partner organisations to clear the beach.\"This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTen people have been taken to hospital after a double-decker bus crashed into a bridge and had its roof torn off.\n\nThe crash happened in Cook Street in Glasgow, near the O2 venue, at 11.35 BST.\n\nThe injured people were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.\n\nA Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said: \"A number of additional casualties have been treated at the scene but do not require to be taken to hospital.\"\n\nThe crash happened in Cook Street on the south side of Glasgow\n\nThe roof viewed from behind the bus after the smash\n\nSeveral people were treated at the scene for minor injuries\n\nCh Insp Elaine Tomlinson, of Police Scotland's Greater Glasgow Division, said: \"Around 11.35am on Sunday, 21 May, 2023, we received a report of a bus crashing into a bridge on Cook Street, Glasgow.\n\n\"Emergency services attended and 10 people were taken to various hospitals for treatment.\n\n\"A number of road closures remain in place, with disruption to some rail services.\n\n\"I would like to thank the public for their co-operation and ask they continue to avoid the area while enquires are ongoing.\"\n\nFirst Bus confirmed it was one of its buses which was involved.\n\nA company spokesperson said: \"We are working closely with the emergency services at the scene and our thoughts are with those involved in the incident.\"\n\nNetwork Rail said its engineers would need to carry out an inspection of the bridge before it could be used by trains again.\n\nThe rail infrastructure agency said: \"We're assisting the emergency services, who are responding to a bus trapped beneath a bridge between Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street.\n\n\"We need to complete a safety inspection of the bridge before trains can use it again.

Joe Biden said his trip would focus on keeping the peace as he departed Joint Base Andrews in Maryland for Belfast\n\nAhead of his arrival, Mr Biden said: \"I look forward to marking the anniversary in Belfast, underscoring the US commitment to preserving peace and encouraging prosperity.\"\n\nHis visit to Belfast will be the first leg of a four-day stay in Ireland, during which he will discuss his Irish roots and meet Irish relatives.\n\nMr Biden's trip comes two weeks after MI5 said the terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland had increased due to a rise in activity by dissident republicans.\n\nDuring an illegal parade by dissident republicans in Londonderry on Monday petrol bombs were thrown at a police vehicle but the violence was confined to one area and ended a short time later.\n\nOn Tuesday, police found four suspected pipe bombs inside the grounds of the City Cemetery in Derry. They believe they were to be used in a planned attack on officers after Monday's parade.\n\nThe president's spokesman said Mr Biden was \"more than comfortable making this trip\" despite the terrorism threat.\n\nOn Monday the 80-year-old dropped another hint that he would seek re-election in 2024, saying he planned to run again but was \"not prepared to announce it yet\".\n\nThe president left Washington DC on Air Force One at about 10:00 EDT (15:00 BST) and will be met by PM Rishi Sunak when he lands at Belfast International Airport later.\n\nPolice have warned of traffic delays around the airport as officers facilitate the presidential motorcade.\n\nMr Biden will arrive as strong winds and heavy rain are sweeping across Northern Ireland, with a weather warning having been issued by forecasters.\n\nHundreds of extra police officers have been drafted into Belfast ahead of Joe Biden's arrival\n\nHe is expected to stay at a Belfast city centre hotel and, while his visit to Northern Ireland is much shorter than originally expected, Downing Street has dismissed suggestions it will be a \"low-key\" event.\n\nThe main event will be a speech at the new Ulster University campus in Belfast.\n\nIt is understood that he will use that to underscore the willingness of the US to help to preserve what he sees as the peace and prosperity gained since the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe president is also expected to talk about how the US administration can support Northern Ireland's economy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAnd he is expected to meet the leaders of Stormont's five main political parties at some point during his brief time in the city.\n\nThere has been a huge police presence in the centre of Belfast since Monday afternoon and that will continue all through Tuesday and into Wednesday.\n\nOn Bedford Street police officers are patrolling at barricades close to the Grand Central Hotel but pedestrians can pass through and businesses in the area are operating as usual.\n\nThere has been some tension behind the scenes about the details of this visit.\n\nThings have been strained between Downing Street and the White House in terms of what the president will do in Northern Ireland and the fact that he will not go to Stormont.\n\nRishi Sunak was keen to have his moment - this is, after all, a US presidential visit to the UK on his watch.\n\nHe will greet the", "but it's like they have their eyes closed.\"\n\nA separate team of divers, drawn from the ranks of the Maryland State Police, stands ready to dive if and when investigators believe they have found the remains of the three men still missing from the collapse.\n\nThe continued search for those men, she added, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those involved in the salvage operation.\n\n\"These are families that did not get to celebrate Easter together,\" she said. \"This is very solemn ground.\"\n\nThose involved in the operation and maritime experts say that the scope of the operation has few, if any comparisons.\n\nAn initial $60m (\u00a347.4m) in emergency funds have been earmarked to cover the work. The true cost may be much higher, with one politician, Maryland Democrat David Trone, telling CBS that the cost could eventually rise to $1bn.\n\n\"The scale is the biggest challenge, but also the complexity,\" said Captain Dan Hoban, a British Royal Engineer who was on a routine exchange with the US Army Corps of Engineers when the bridge collapsed.\n\n\"It's a really messy situation. From an engineering perspective, we are trying to figure out where the cuts are going to be made and then incorporate that into a lifting plan,\" added Capt Hoban, who has been helping with the mission.\n\n\"But it needs to be safe for all those operating out there,\" he added. \"Everyone wants to get going quickly, but trying to do so safely and efficiently. We don't want to create a more difficult situation. That's the key.\"\n\nLarge crane barges are also serving as launch pads for extensive dive operations around the Dali\n\nPeter Ford, a long time merchant mariner whose firm SkyRock Advisors specialises in infrastructure projects, said that the \"intricacies\" of the Baltimore operation made it considerably more hazardous than other complex operations, such as that which freed the Ever Given, after it got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021.\n\n\"This is beyond anything we've seen,\" he said. \"It's all going to be hard. It's the mixture of the infrastructure above and below water and the fact that debris is literally draped over and balancing on the vessel.\"\n\nOnce salvage crews begin cutting larger pieces of the debris, Mr Ford predicts that the constant shifting and movement of the debris and the vessel alike can become a potentially dangerous challenge.\n\n\"God forbid that somebody miscalculates and this very sharp steel ends up cutting into a part of the ship where the bunker fuel is, or some sort of hazardous commodities on the vessel are breached and leaked into the ocean,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a game of Jenga you don't want to lose.\"\n\nWorkers plan to use specialised cutting tools and hydraulic shears to remove parts of the Key Bridge\n\nFor now, the salvage operation is still in its early stages and is largely focused on assessing the scene and the bridge, removing smaller pieces and have so far opened smaller temporary shipping channels to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through the area.\n\nBy the end of April, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some roll-on-roll-off vessels that carry cars and equipment.\n\nThe entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the \"unified command\" responsible for the operation said in a statement on 4 April.\n\nThat target date, however, may change because of the weather or unforeseen problems with the clearance operations.\n\n\"We have to go slow to go fast.

I took that option as I wasn't just doing it for myself.\n\n\"After donating I started to feel quite guilty. I wasn't sure that I had done the right thing.

If the government chooses not to do so, I will ask for these to be returned to my office so that I can provide them to you directly.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward said the risk of turning on Mr Johnson's old phone was \"minimal\", adding: \"It is perfectly possible to do that without exposing it to the potential threat.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the inquiry told the government to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic by 16:00 BST on Thursday.\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"more than happy\" to give the unredacted material to the inquiry.\n\nThe Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - also holds communications between ministers and civil servants which do not involve Mr Johnson.\n\nOn Thursday, it missed the deadline and said it would \"with regret\" be launching a judicial review of the demand, but promised to \"continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry\".\n\nDefending its decision not to hand over certain messages, the Cabinet Office argued that many of the communications were \"unambiguously irrelevant\", and that to submit them to the inquiry would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.\n\n\"It represents an unwarranted intrusion into other aspects of the work of government. It also represents an intrusion into their legitimate expectations of privacy and protection of their personal information,\" the Cabinet Office said, in a letter to the inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, science minister George Freeman said he thought the \"courts will probably take the view\" that Baroness Hallett was entitled to decide \"what evidence she deems relevant\".\n\nBut he added \"people's privacy is really important\" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a \"point worth testing\".\n\n\"I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid.

The Liberal Democrats called it a \"kick in the teeth for bereaved families\".\n\nLord Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Theresa May, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the government was making a \"bad mistake\".\n\nHe added: \"We're having the inquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth. And if the government is controlling what the inquiry can and can't see, then people are not going to get confidence in the outcome.\"Toby Burwell went missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon in February\n\nThe body of a missing 17-year-old boy has been recovered from a quarry in Warwickshire.\n\nPolice divers found the body in Newbold Quarry, Rugby, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe was formally identified as Toby Burwell, who had been missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon since 20 February.\n\nHis death is not currently being treated as suspicious, Warwickshire Police said.\n\nA force spokesperson added: \"Our thoughts remain with Toby's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nPolice had been searching the water and land around Newbold Quarry since Toby's disappearance more than six weeks ago.\n\nThe 17-year-old was known to have previously gone swimming in the quarry at night.\n\nLast week, Warwickshire Police said the evidence gathered strongly suggested Toby had got into difficulty while swimming in the quarry and never left the water.\n\n\"At present, the evidence we have gathered strongly supports the conclusion that Toby went to Newbold Quarry alone for a swim and that, tragically, he got into difficulty and remains in the water,\" Det Insp Gareth Unett said in a statement agreed with Toby's family at the time.\n\nSpecialist search officers, police divers, sonar and underwater drones had been used during the search operation, which was hampered by poor visibility and underwater hazards.\n\nA file is now being prepared for the coroner, Warwickshire Police confirmed.\n\u2022 None Missing teen likely never left quarry, police sayJoe Abbess, 17, was pulled from the water near Bournemouth Pier\n\nThe family of a 17-year-old boy who died after being pulled from the sea in Bournemouth say they are \"heartbroken and devastated\" at his death.\n\nJoe Abbess and a 12-year-old girl, named locally as Sunnah Khan, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, died in the incident involving 10 swimmers on Wednesday.\n\nJoe and Sunnah both suffered critical injuries and died in hospital.\n\nJoe's parents said they had been \"privileged to have him in our lives\".\n\nDorset Police said it was continuing to investigate what had happened.\n\nMore than 200 people are understood to have attended Sunnah Khan's funeral on Saturday\n\nIn a statement, Joe", "KC, defending, said the punch was \"mistaken\" in that it was \"a reaction to an item thrown by somebody else\" and \"lacked premeditation\".\n\n\"It is clear that the defendant is extremely remorseful,\" he said.\n\n\"He badly regrets the tragic consequences of his unlawful actions and he will have to live with that.\"\n\nOn Garwood's decision not to call an ambulance before he left the property, Mr Elias said: \"It seemed for a while that the defendant was going to be OK.\"\n\nShe said Garwood was an \"impulsive individual with little or no regard for the consequences of [his] actions\".\n\nGarwood, from Newport, was sentenced to six years in custody, of which he will have to spend at least four in prison.

At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026 The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\n\nThis mortgage calculator uses a standard mortgage repayment formula to estimate the monthly payments or interest rate based on the amount borrowed and the length of a mortgage.\n\nThe calculator assumes a single, fixed, interest rate which stays the same over the term of the mortgage and interest is charged monthly.\n\nWhy is my monthly payment estimate different to what I actually pay?\n\nIf there is a difference you can enter your current monthly payment instead of the interest rate.\n\nWhat if I have a variable rate mortgage?\n\nThis calculator assumes that the interest rate stays the same over the term of the mortgage so is not suitable for variable rate mortgages.\n\nWhat if I have an interest only mortgage?\n\nThis calculator only works for repayment mortgages.\n\nWhat if I have more than one mortgage?\n\nThis calculator only works for a single mortgage at a time.\n\nWhat if I don't know what my interest rate or monthly payments are or would be?\n\nYou can use mortgage comparison tools on official mortgage lender's websites to see what a likely interest rate or monthly payment would be for the amount you were looking to borrow.\n\nWhat are the values already in the calculator based on?\n\nThe value of \u00a3160,000 is based on the average outstanding balance for a fixed rate mortgage as of June 2022, according to UK Finance.\n\nThe value of 20 years is based on the average outstanding term for a fixed rate mortgage as of June 2022, according to UK Finance.\n\nThe value of 2% is based on the average interest rate for outstanding fixed rate mortgages as of June 2022, according to UK Finance.\n\nThe value of \u00a3809 is based on the estimated payments made at 2% based on a mortgage of \u00a3160,000 over 20 years.\n\nThe value of 6.7% is based on research from moneyfactscompare.co.uk from 12 July 2023, who reported this figure as the average rate for a new two-year fixed rate loan.Kyriakos Mitsotakis trounced his rivals for a second time in a month and now has a majority\n\nGreek conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has trounced his centre-left rival in the second election in a month and said he has a \"strong mandate\" to move faster on the path of change.\n\nHis New Democracy party (ND) won 40.5% of the national vote, almost 23 points ahead of Alexis Tsipras's Syriza party.\n\nHe beat Syriza in May, but called new elections in a bid to win a majority.\n\n\"ND is today the most powerful centre-right party in Europe,\" he told delighted supporters in Athens.\n\nMr Mitsotakis, who was sworn as prime minister on Monday, is credited with successfully returning the Greek economy to stability and growth after a severe debt crisis and three international bailouts.\n\nAlthough many Greeks are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, voters chose to stick with the party promising lower taxes and improved public health.\n\nThe vote came 11 days after a migrant boat tragedy off Greece in which about 500 people are thought to have died.\n\nThree days of mourning were held, however the disaster had little effect on the campaign and Greeks voted to maintain economic stability.\n\n\"The people have given us a safe majority,\" said Mr Mitsotakis as the extent of his victory became clear. \"Major reforms will go ahead quickly.\"\n\nLast month, his party fell just short of a majority in the 300-seat parliament and his decision to call an election in a bid to form a stable, single-party government was vindicated by Sunday's result.\n\nUnder Greek rules for a second election, the biggest party is awarded a bonus of between 20 and 50 seats. With more than 40% of the vote, New Democracy won all 50.\n\nMr Mitsotakis said he could not promise miracles, but that New Democracy had \"high goals\" to transform Greece with a better public health service and education.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's centre-left Syriza had been soundly defeated in the first election and lost further ground in the second, with less than 18% of the vote. He dampened speculation that he would resign, saying that was a decision for his party members.\n\nOne of the big stories of the election was the success of a newly created far-right Spartans party, which won almost 4.7% of the vote, crossing the 3% threshold to enter parliament.\n\nThe Spartans only emerged as a political force this month when the Supreme Court banned another far-right party, the Greeks, and its jailed founder, Ilias Kasidiaris, threw his weight behind the Spartans.\n\nKasidiaris had been the spokesman for neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, which was banned as a criminal organisation and its leaders given long prison terms.\n\nTogether with nationalist Greek Solution and ultra-conservative Niki (Victory), the three hard-right parties won close to 13% of the vote and 34 seats.\n\nThe victory secured by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, 55, over Alexis Tsipras's Syriza is a rarity in Greek politics, as few parties increase their share after a first term in office.\n\nHe also succeeded in attracting more young voters than his rival.\n\nAlexis Tsipras said his future as leader was in the hands of party members\n\nHis party was helped by the fragmentation of the left-wing vote; with Socialist PASOK set for more than 11% and the Communist KKE on around 7%.\n\nTurnout slumped eight points from the first vote to less than 53%.\n\nThe conservative leader has formed a reputation as a Teflon-coated leader, fending off a series of damaging crises in the past year, including a rail disaster and a wire-tapping scandal that brought down the intelligence chief and his own nephew, who worked as the prime minister's chief of staff.\n\nGreece was being led by a caretaker government when the migrant boat sank off the south-west coast in the early hours of 14 June.\n\nSince the migrant crisis, the views of most Greek voters have shifted in favour of stricter, more conservative policies, says Panos Koliastasis, assistant professor of politics at the University of Peloponnese.\n\n\"The reason is", "to announce it was investing \u00a315m to reduce the cost of basics such as rice, pasta and chicken.\n\nHowever, some items such as milk and eggs remain relatively expensive compared to pre-Covid prices.\n\nJamie Keeble, co-founder of sausage and burger maker Heck which supplies most of the major supermarkets, told the BBC's Today programme that the price of pork was expected to remain high for the next 18 months.\n\nHe said the only way supermarkets could lower their prices was by asking suppliers to cut costs, but he added: \"We're certainly not in the position to start giving cost decreases on our products.\n\n\"At the end of the day, [the supermarkets] are going to have to take a cut in their margins if they really want to lower the prices on the shelf, that's the only way to do it.\"\n\nSeparately, all four supermarket executives backed calls for more transparency on fuel prices, after MPs highlighted that prices for petrol and diesel were lower in Northern Ireland as a result of data being shared widely with drivers.\n\nA study by academics at the London School of Economics last month found nearly a third of food price inflation since 2019 was due to Brexit.\n\nHow is the price of food changing your diet?

These officers under investigation are the police.\"\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was launched following a Sunday Times investigation into a phone owned by Mr Jones.\n\nThe newspaper said that racist images, pornographic videos and sensitive information about misconduct and corruption investigations were among the material exchanged between Mr Jones and former colleagues.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the IOPC said three serving and two former officers had been served with misconduct notices in relation to the messages found on Mr Jones' phone.\n\nA further four officers - one of whom has retired - were identified as being involved in a WhatsApp group where messages were shared. They are being investigated over claims that they failed to challenge or report inappropriate messages sent by colleagues.\n\nThe IOPC said a further two serving officers are under criminal investigation for allegedly unauthorised disclosure of police information to Mr Jones after he had left the force. They had been served with gross misconduct notices but are not being investigated over the phone messages.\n\nGwent Police said inappropriate behaviour had no place in the force\n\nMisconduct notices advise officers that they are being investigated but charges will not necessarily follow, the watchdog said.\n\nDavid Ford, the director of the IOPC, said the officers being investigated ranged from police constable to inspecting ranks.\n\nHe said the watchdog was also examining when Gwent Police became aware of Ricky Jones' family's concerns about the messages and what steps the force took to explore them.\n\n\"We will progress the investigation as swiftly as possible, but given the number of officers and the non-recent nature of the alleged conduct, inquiries will take some time,\" Mr Ford said.\n\nA separate Wiltshire Police investigation is ongoing into a series of complaints from the family of Mr Jones, relating to Gwent Police's handling of its investigation into his death and officers' contact with his relatives.\n\nGwent Police's Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Williams said: \"We are grateful to the IOPC for the pace at which they are conducting this investigation.\n\n\"It is important that these matters receive a full and thorough investigation in a timely way, and we will continue to work with both the IOPC and Wiltshire Police to support this.\n\n\"We are absolutely clear with both our colleagues and communities that inappropriate behaviour has no place in this force and we remain resolute in our commitment to root out such behaviours.\n\n\"I hope that the speed and scale of this investigation will give the public confidence around the commitment in policing to tackle unacceptable behaviours.\"The murals adorned the walls of the Kent Intake Unit\n\nMurals of Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters designed to welcome child asylum seekers to a reception centre in Dover have been painted over, by order of the immigration minister.\n\nRobert Jenrick instructed that they be removed, reportedly because he believed they sent too welcoming a message.\n\nThe Home Office said the Kent Intake Unit (KIU) opened last November to look after unaccompanied child migrants.\n\nFacilities included softer interview rooms and an outside space, it added.\n\nThere were also prayer rooms, a larger reception area and improved security measures to ensure children's safety, the Home Office said.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed the murals were removed on Tuesday, adding: \"We do all we can to ensure children are safe, secure and supported as we urgently seek placements with a local authority.\n\n\"All children receive a welfare interview on their arrival at accommodation, which includes questions designed to identify potential indicators of trafficking or safeguarding issues.\n\n\"Our priority is to stop the boats and disrupt the people smugglers.\"\n\nLabour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock condemned Mr Jenrick's order, saying the idea that removing the murals would \"somehow stop the boats is utterly absurd\".\n\nHe said it was a sign of a \"chaotic government in crisis, whose failing approach means all they have left is tough talk and cruel and callous policies\".\n\nLabour had a plan to \"end the dangerous crossings, defeat the criminal smuggler gangs, and end hotel use by clearing the asylum backlog,\" he added.\n\nThe i newspaper, which was first to report the story, quoted sources as saying staff at the centre were \"horrified\" by Mr Jenrick's order and resisted carrying out the work.\n\nA report published last month by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons after visits to KIU, and the nearby processing centres at Manston and Western Jet Foil, found there had been improvements in facilities since previous inspections.\n\nBut continuing problems, including medical isolation practices at KIU. The report concluded: \"Inspectors found no examples of notable positive practice during this inspection\" at KIU.\n\nThe Home Office said it had taken action to address some of the recommendations.Shane Loughlin, Eve Smith, Sophie Russon, Rafel Jeanne and Darcy Ross (clockwise from top left) had been reported missing\n\nPolice searching for five people have found three dead and two injured two days after they went missing following a night out.\n\nGwent Police said it believed the group had been involved in a car crash.\n\nSophie Russon, 20, Eve Smith, 21, Darcy Ross, 21, Rafel Jeanne, 24, and Shane Loughlin, 32, were last seen at about 02:00 GMT on Saturday in Cardiff.\n\nThe family of Ms Smith have named her on social media as being one of those who has died.\n\nFamily and friends made repeated appeals to find the missing group over the course of the weekend, with the mother of one of the girls saying she had been told to stop contacting police for updates.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video", "was similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThat has been viewed as a difficult settlement because of the high rate of inflation and outstanding pay disputes involving nurses and other health workers.\n\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy in Northern Ireland said: \"The current political hiatus has created an intolerable situation for public services here and will add to the significant pressures already facing the health and social care system.\"\n\nIt added that although it did not yet have exact figures, it was \"extremely concerned\" by the anticipated cuts to number of physiotherapy undergraduate training places at Ulster University (UU).\n\nThe number of nursing training places is to be cut from September\n\n\"The health and social care service in Northern Ireland already has record numbers of workforce vacancies,\" the society said.\n\n\"Last year saw approximately 900 applications for roughly 100 training places for the physiotherapy course in [UU] Magee.\"\n\nOn Monday, the BBC revealed that the number of nursing training places is to be cut in September from 1,325 to 1,025.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director, Rita Devlin, described the move as an \"act of destruction\".\n\nThe department said it recognised the importance of staffing and was committed to 1,025 new nursing places.\n\nThis was the level in place before the New Decade, New Approach deal, which included provision for an extra 300 nurse training places each year to address staff shortages and concerns over safety.\n\nBut Ms Devlin said the news of cuts had left members \"bewildered\" with almost 3,000 vacant nursing posts in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"It is unimaginable that the Department of Health has been put in the position of having to cut the number of student nursing places for 2023-2024 because of the political and financial crisis in Northern Ireland,\" she explained.By September 2025, working parents of children from the age of nine months will be eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare during term time\n\nThe government's plan to expand funded childcare for working parents \"will not work\" unless the amount paid to providers is right, MPs have warned.\n\nUnderfunding had left the sector \"straining to provide\" enough places for children, the Education Committee report found.\n\nEarly-years charities have welcomed the inquiry's focus on the challenges facing the sector.\n\nThe government says it is increasing the amount it pays childcare providers.\n\nWorking parents of three- and four-year-olds are eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare during term time - but by September 2025, this will be extended to cover children aged nine months and above.\n\nRobin Walker, who chairs the committee, said the childcare market faced significant challenges in \"affordability and availability\" and \"simply extending the number of hours that the government calls 'free' will not work unless the funding rates accurately reflect the costs of providing high-quality early education and childcare\".\n\nThe report warns it is vital the government \"gets this right, or the already struggling childcare market will see even more closures\" and the sector needs \"radically more financial and regulatory reform\".\n\nThe MPs also want better evidence of the effects of formal childcare on under-twos and say there should be more support for parents who choose to stay at home to look after their children.\n\nNursery owner Nicola Fluery says parents are booking nursery places \"well in advance\"\n\nMany settings currently charged children not on funded hours more, to compensate for the hours government paid for, the inquiry heard.\n\nNicola Fluery, who owns the Kidzrus Nursery Group, in Salford, Greater Manchester, said funding had been an issue \"for many years\" and she had had to supplement the amount the government paid for those children eligible for funded hours, in other ways, \"for example, bank loans\".\n\nIn April, the government's planned rollout of the extension of funded childcare for working parents will begin, starting with 15 hours for two-year-olds. And Kidzrus nurseries are already receiving calls from parents keen not to miss out.\n\nDemand \"will far outweigh the number of places available\", Ms Fleury fears.\n\nNational Day Nurseries Association chief executive Purnima Tanuku agrees \"the policy could fail\" if it fails to tackle underfunding.\n\nFrom September, the average hourly rate the government will pay will rise from:\n\nIt is also consulting on proposals to increase the rates for next year.\n\nBut also from September, the number of two-year-olds a staff member is expected to look after will rise, which the report said was deeply concerning and should be closely monitored and \"reversed if quality and education outcomes suffer\".\n\nThe wide-ranging report had a number of recommendations, with the committee calling for:\n\nParents in training or education should also be able to access government-funded hours, the report recommends.\n\nThe Department for Education said it was rolling out \"the single biggest investment in childcare in England ever, set to save a working parent using 30 hours of childcare up to an average of \u00a36,500 per year and give children the best quality early-years education\".\n\n\"To make sure that we are supporting our fantastic early-years workforce, we will be investing hundreds of millions of pounds each year to increase the amounts we pay childcare providers,\" an official said.\n\n\"We also are consulting on how we distribute funding to make sure it is fair.\"\n\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

With those eyes, they ask us: Why? Why all this death? Why all this destruction? War is always an absurdity and a defeat.\"\n\nPope Francis also warned countries against re-arming themselves and spoke about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine just over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour.\n\nChildren in Gaza have lost their smiles, the Pope said\n\n\"In calling for respect for the principles of international law, I express my hope for a general exchange of all prisoners between Russia and Ukraine,\" the Pope said.\n\nThe war in Gaza began after Hamas's unprecedented attack in southern Israel during which about 1,200 people were killed and some 253 taken hostage.\n\nIsrael launched a retaliatory operation, saying it was aimed at destroying Hamas.

They did not want to draw attention to their school - or pupils who identify as trans or non-binary.\n\nIn 2018, the government said it would work with the human-rights watchdog to publish \"comprehensive guidance for schools on how to support trans pupils\". Without it, many schools are making their own decisions, such as whether to introduce gender-neutral toilets or changing rooms - and how they are used.\n\nSome teachers told BBC News they worried whatever they did would \"not only be criticised but publicly vilified\" and, while schools needed clarity, it was a \"no-win\" situation.\n\nOthers said they might have to consult solicitors, amid fears of doing the \"wrong thing\".\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton told BBC News many schools wanted better guidance and advice to help make decisions \"in the best interests of the child\".\n\nHis, Chesterfield High School, a mixed-sex comprehensive in Crosby, Merseyside, has developed its own approach.\n\nThe school has more than 1,200 pupils, 10-20 of whom identify as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid.\n\nThere are single-sex and gender-neutral toilets, with floor-to-ceiling lockable cubicles and a supervising member of staff. And private PE changing rooms, used by all the trans pupils, are available to all.\n\nThe school's support for children questioning their gender identity had been developed over the past decade, Mr Sexton said.\n\n\"We've tried to create a school that's tolerant and inclusive,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll work with individual children to actually think about what they want to use and access - and it becomes really manageable.\"\n\nChesterfield High had never faced a challenge from parents - but other head teachers had.\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton says everyone should feel safe and happy at school\n\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked almost 7,000 teachers in England a series of questions about their experience with transgender pupils.\n\nAbout 8% of primary-school teachers said they taught trans or non-binary pupils, compared with 75% in secondary.\n\nAnd just over half said they would not be very or at all confident about the next steps to take if a child wanted to change their name, use different pronouns or change their appearance, hairstyle or clothes - what is known as socially transitioning.\n\nWhen and how schools should involve parents if a child wishes to identify as a gender different to their birth sex - and what to do if a parent disagrees - are among the most controversial matters the guidance is expected to address.\n\nEvery classroom at Chesterfield High School has a pride flag\n\nA report into gender-identity services in England says socially transitioning may have significant psychological effects - and better information is needed about its outcomes.\n\nAnd last year, an NHS England consultation proposed socially transitioning should be considered in certain circumstances only, such as to alleviate or prevent \"clinically significant distress\".\n\nAbout three-quarters of the teachers in the Teacher Tapp survey said their school would support a child who wished to socially transition.\n\nAnd 39% of the secondary teachers who responded said they would support this, regardless of parental consent.\n\n\"Everyone involved in a child's life should work together and investigate why a child may feel a certain way,\" says Tanya Carter, of the Safe Schools Alliance organisation, which is worried about how some schools are managing gender identity.\n\n\"Teachers are not doctors. [Socially transitioning] is something that should only be done with medical oversight. Concerns arise when schools affirm someone as the opposite sex, locking in what may or not may not be a transient phase in that child's life.\"\n\nThe organisation receives several messages every day from both parents and teachers worried about toilets, changing rooms, sports and overnight accommodation on school trips becoming mixed-sex.\n\n\"We get parents who have found out that their children have been socially transitioned behind their backs at schools, because the schools haven't spoken to parents,\" Miss Carter says. \"Schools are keeping secrets from parents.\"\n\nPenni Allen, who runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, says the school takes parents' views into account but that \"doesn't mean that we're not going to continue supporting that child\".\n\nThe school tries to de-escalate any emotions and issues with parents and help the child understand what they are feeling.\n\n\"Some children will come and say they're just exploring,\" Mrs Allen says. \"Others will say they've been feeling this way for quite some time. They might just be at the start of a journey that never goes anywhere.\n\n\"It's not about putting them on a pathway. We don't put your child in a box and put a label on it that says, 'Your child is now trans.'\n\n\"We like to think we've got a good relationship with parents here\u2026 and hopefully, we get it right.\"\n\nPenni Allen runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, where pupils can talk to counsellors about difficulties, including around gender identity\n\nBBC News spoke to parents of trans children at other schools in England but, as with teachers, it is difficult to find a view everyone agrees with and will speak about on record.\n\nSome parents told BBC News they did not want any decisions made without their approval and were not happy with their children changing their names or pronouns.\n\nSome felt their children may be struggling with their sexual orientation, rather than gender identity, and needed space and time to explore that before making other decisions, which could potentially lead down a medical pathway such as puberty blockers.\n\nBut others wanted schools to put their child's choices first, regardless of their own involvement, and were supportive of their trans identity and socially transitioning.\n\nThe decisions schools make, or do not make, can have a huge impact on the young people affected.\n\nE", "'re the mothership of online trolling.\n\n\"Trolls react and mobilise to stories they create.

It is incredibly important for me when I'm constructing budgets to have someone that I can turn to who speaks for British business.\"\n\nMr McBride said he wanted to give members reasons to consider trusting the lobby group again.\n\nBut said: \"Whether that is possible, I simply don't know.\"\n\nMr McBride said he was concerned that CBI staff felt that their only option was to go to the Guardian newspaper - which first published the claims - instead of feeling confident enough to raise the matter internally.\n\nOne female CBI worker had told the Guardian that she had been stalked by a male colleague in 2018.\n\nThe business group upheld a complaint of harassment against the man however, he was allowed to keep working in the same office as the woman. He eventually left for an unrelated reasons, according to the newspaper.\n\nEarlier this month, the lobby group fired its director-general, Tony Danker, who joined the CBI in 2020, following separate complaints of workplace misconduct.\n\nMr Danker acknowledged he had made some staff feel \"very uncomfortable\" and apologised, but said his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims andthat his reputation had been \"destroyed\".\n\nHe is being replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's former chief economist, who is returning to the lobby group after a brief stint at Barclays.\n\nDame Carolyn Fairbairn was the director-general of the CBI between 2015 and 2020. The BBC has contacted her for comment.\n\nMr McBride said the CBI had accepted all 35 recommendations made by Fox Williams investigators and added the organisation had 60 days to produce an action plan for its members to vote one.\n\nThe CBI's president said the organisation had to \"go for a much more zero-tolerance culture\" and get \"much more severe in dealing\" with incidents of bullying and sexual harassment.\n\n\"For us it's about rebuilding the trust that we obviously lost with the members who left us,\" he said.\n\nBut Andy Wood, chief executive of the brewing company Adnams, which has cancelled its membership of the CBI, said he had not heard anything so far that \"reassures me that I should become a member of the CBI again\".\n\nHe said he was not sure if the group was \"salvageable\".\n\n\"Zero tolerance of bullying and sexual harassment - that has to be a given in a modern organisation,\" Mr Wood said.\n\n\"It just shows really how archaic the CBI was behind the scenes. I applaud them for trying to put their house in order but this does feel [like] a few things being done far too late.\"The headlines were terrifying. Hospitals facing intolerable pressures with patients left dying in corridors, the BBC reported.\n\nIt got so bad that 68 leading A&E doctors wrote to the prime minister to spell out their concerns.\n\nThis is not now though. It was the winter of 2017-18 - the last bad flu season when more than 300 people a day were dying from that virus at one point.\n\nAnd that was not even a one-off. In January 2016 hospitals were cancelling routine operations, telling patients to stay away from A&E if they could, and emergency treatment areas were being set up outside some units - just as they are now.\n\nThe truth is the past decade has been a story of lengthening waits and declining performance.\n\nA&E waits are the best barometer of this. The proportion of patients waiting less than four hours - a key metric in measuring NHS effectiveness - has been gradually eroded.\n\nIt is a similar story elsewhere in the UK - with performance even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis should not come as a surprise, as NHS spending has been squeezed.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2019 the annual rises for health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS, making it difficult to keep up with the needs of the ageing population.\n\nDuring that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years.\n\nBut it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either.\n\nThe financial crash of 2008 meant all the main political parties were signed up to the idea that spending had to be curtailed.\n\nThis parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now planned to be close to 4% and will end up higher once the pandemic spending is taken into account.\n\nBut the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours.\n\nThe turn of the year is always the hardest time. And with the latest data for A&E only covering November, we need to look elsewhere to judge how alarming the current pressures driven by the Omicron variant are.\n\nSince Christmas there have been reports of hospitals declaring critical incidents. At one point on Wednesday evening, one in seven hospital trusts in England were in this situation.\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. How is the NHS in your area coping this winter? This trust does not currently supply A&E waiting time figures. When patients arrive at hospital by ambulance they should be handed over within 15 minutes. This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival", ".

It's not safe for the schedule monument itself but also for the people who are breaking in,\" said Nick.\n\nNick has a team of volunteers working to help secure the structure but admits they are \"a lifetime away\" from being able to open it up to the public.\n\n\"In the meantime, we're looking to allow for some explorers, such as Steve to safely access it in a way that lets it kind of live,\" he said.\n\nNick describes the task of preserving the building as a \"passion project\"\n\nDespite the overwhelming scale of the project he is undeterred.\n\n\"It's a hell of a project,\" he said. \"It's been effectively untouched for 100 years so the preservation is on another level.\n\n\"The fact that that nature is taking over again is part of the appeal of it, it's all aesthetically so incredible.\"Warning have been put in place at some north coast beaches\n\nPotentially toxic blue-green algae have been spotted at fresh locations along the north coast, Northern Ireland environmental authorities have warned.\n\nThe bacteria were found at Portstewart and Castlerock beaches earlier this week.\n\nRed flag warnings were extended west to the beach at Downhill on Sunday, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said.\n\nThese have also been extended to Benone beach as a precautionary measure.\n\nRed flag warnings were extended west to the beach at Downhill on Sunday\n\nBlue-green algae is not actually an alga but rather a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria.\n\nIt can cause illness in humans but is particularly dangerous for pets and has been implicated in the deaths of several dogs in other locations where it has been detected.\n\nSwimmers and dog walkers have been advised to adhere to any advice about getting into the water.\n\nScientists from the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute are working with DAERA, assisting with modelling to predict how tidal flows will affect the algal blooms.\n\nDownhill Beach is popular with dog walkers but pet owners have been warned of the possibility of potentially toxic algae\n\nA scientist told BBC News NI last Friday that the organism cannot survive in salt water, but it was still being washed from Lough Neagh down the River Bann to the coast.\n\nThe DAERA officials have encouraged people to get involved in citizen science and help monitor the presence of blue-green algae, via an app or by contacting the department directly.There have been calls for Orkney to become part of Norway\n\nOrkney councillors have voted to investigate alternative methods of governance amid deep frustrations over funding and opportunities.\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan said the islands had been \"held down\" and accused the Scottish and UK governments of discrimination.\n\nHis motion led to media speculation that Orkney could leave the UK or become a self-governing territory of Norway.\n\nIt was supported by 15 votes to six.\n\nIt means council officers have been asked to publish a report to Orkney's chief executive on options of governance.\n\nThis includes looking at the \"Nordic connections\" of the archipelago and crown dependencies such as Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nA further change which would see the revival of a consultative group on constitutional reform for the islands was accepted without the need for a vote.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister's spokesperson rejected the suggestion the islands could loosen its ties with the union.\n\nMr Stockan urged councillors to back his idea to find new ways to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians.\n\nSpeaking to councillors on Tuesday, he said the motion was \"not about us joining Norway\".\n\nHe added: \"I say it's time for government to take us seriously and I say it's time for us to look at all the options we've got.\n\n\"There is a far bigger suite of options here - this could even be that we could get our money direct from the Treasury in London and look after our own future.\n\n\"We have been held down and we all know most of what I could say today in terms of discrimination against this community from governments. We all know how much less we get compared to other island groups.\"\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan says Orkney does not get fair funding within the UK\n\nOrkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy.\n\nWhile councillors wanted to have a \"stronger voice\", they did not back full independence for Orkney.\n\nCurrently, most of the island's 21 councillors sit as independents - two are Greens.\n\nMr Stockan has said an ageing ferry fleet is among the issues being faced by islanders.\n\nHe previously told the BBC the situation was \"critical\" because the ferries, which are older than the Western Isles fleet, were beginning to fail.\n\nHis concerns were widely shared by other councillors, however some raised issues with self-governance, such as the cost of carrying out such investigations.\n\nCllr Steven Heddle also mentioned disadvantages including having to buy back the sea bed, and tuition fees for students wishing to study in Scotland.\n\nHe called Mr Stockan's efforts \"politics of grievance\" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were \"worse\" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: \"First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.\n\n\"We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with \u00a350m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.\n\n\"But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.\"\n\nOrkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.\n\nThe islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.\n\nA spokesperson added it was \"committed to supporting island communities\".\n\nThe", "are being asked to provide their views until 26 July, in a consultation run by watchdogs Transport Focus and London Travelwatch.\n\nTrain drivers in the Aslef union have also been taking action short of a strike in the form of an overtime ban at 15 train companies. The next overtime ban will be from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August.\n\nThis could cause some reduced timetables and last-minute cancellations.\n\nIn London, strikes on the Underground have been called off following last-minute talks.\n\nTraffic is expected to increase as we head into the summer holiday season, and roads could be busier than usual as train strikes push people into cars instead.\n\n\"It's likely that people will consider altering their journey plans and they may well travel by car instead so it's important they check their vehicle is roadworthy before setting off,\" says Frank Bird, senior network planner at National Highways.\n\n\"We'd also remind motorists to check the weather forecast... and to take plenty of drinking water with them as well as food that won't be affected by the heat in case of delays.\"\n\nThere were long queues at Dover during the Easter holidays\n\nDover is Europe's busiest ferry port, and summer is its peak time as passengers head across the Channel.\n\nIt will be under the spotlight again after many passengers experienced long queues last July and during this year's Easter holidays.\n\nHolidaymakers are being warned to expect to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to pass additional passport checks introduced after Brexit.\n\nIn late May, port boss Doug Bannister told the BBC everything possible had been done to prevent the same level of delays.\n\nHowever, he said \"it would be foolish\" to guarantee there would never be queues. Mr Bannister added that additional passport checks were a factor.\n\nThe port's location between cliffs and the sea means space is limited.\n\nIt says measures in place ahead of the summer holidays include working with coach and ferry operators to spread out travel at peak times, extra space to process coach passengers, and putting in more border control posts.\n\nLocal authorities and emergency services have traffic management plans for busy times, including queuing up lorries on the M20 motorway.\n\nThis system was reinstated ahead of the busy July and August period.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Stephen Flynn has been SNP Westminster group leader since the beginning of December last year\n\nThe SNP's Westminster group could miss out on \u00a31.2m in public funds if it fails to file its accounts by the 31 May deadline, its leader has confirmed.\n\nStephen Flynn told the BBC he could not give any commitment as to whether the deadline would be met.\n\nHowever, the MP said \"everything possible\" was being done to ensure this was the case.\n\nMr Flynn said the party was having problems finding new auditors after the previous company resigned in September.\n\nAccountancy firm Johnston Carmichael, which had worked with the party for more than a decade, said the decision was taken after a review of its clients.\n\nHowever, First Minister Humza Yousaf confirmed he only found out about it when he took on his new role at the end of March.\n\nAnd Mr Flynn has told BBC Scotland he only learned of the situation in February.\n\nIt comes amid the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances, which saw its former chief executive Peter Murrell and treasurer Colin Beattie arrested earlier this month.\n\nBoth men were released without charge pending further inquiry.\n\nSeparate accounts need to be submitted for the Westminster group by 31 May in order to receive \"Short Money\" - public funding for opposition parties to carry out their parliamentary work. The SNP is in line for about \u00a31.2m.\n\nMr Flynn told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"I thought it would be a relatively straight forward process to secure new auditors but that's proven not to be the case.\"\n\nHe said this was partly due to the fact that the financial year was nearing its end as well as the overall challenges in the party's finances.\n\nWhen asked if the party would lose its Short Money if the deadline was not met, Mr Flynn said: \"As I understand it, that would be the case, yes.\"\n\nHe described it as a \"situation which is in a state of flux\" and added: \"I wouldn't want to incur any concern amongst staff that we aren't going to be able to meet our deadlines.\"\n\nMr Flynn said he only found out by email on 10 February that the party's auditors had resigned in September.\n\nThis was despite the SNP's former Westminster leader Ian Blackford last week saying that all relevant information was handed over to Mr Flynn during the changeover in December.\n\nMr Flynn said \"there may well have been discussions between other people\" but reiterated that he was only fully informed of the situation on 10 February.\n\n\"I became fully aware of the situation in February,\" he said. \"I received an email from a finance officer who advised me that back in September the party's auditors had opted not to continue and we needed to find our own.\n\n\"So since then we've been in the process of trying to find our own because it's important that we are able to undertake our commitments in that regard.\"\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has said that appointing new auditors was one of his \"major priorities\" and has ordered a governance and transparency review.\n\nPolice Scotland launched its Operation Branchform investigation in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how more than \u00a3600,000 of donations earmarked for independence campaigning were spent.\n\nQuestions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nLast year it emerged that former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is married to former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, gave a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election.\n\nHe was arrested two weeks ago at the couple's home in Glasgow before also being released without charge pending further inquiries.\n\nHe had resigned as SNP chief executive last month after taking responsibility for misleading statements about a fall in party membership.\n\nTreasurer Colin Beattie has now also stepped down. He was also arrested and released without charge as part of the police investigation.Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Watch live on BBC Two, Red Button, the BBC Sport website and app, with live text commentary of selected matches online\n\nCarlos Alcaraz will face Alex de Minaur in the Queen's final for the chance to win a first grass title and return to world number one before Wimbledon.\n\nA win at the London tournament would lift Alcaraz above Novak Djokovic in the rankings and make him top seed for Wimbledon, which starts on 3 July.\n\n\"At the beginning of the week I didn't know that a good result would put me number one but in the press conference yesterday they told me and I thought 'oh my god - it's in my mind, I'm going to go for it',\" Alcaraz said after his win over Korda.\n\nLifting the Queen's trophy would be quite an achievement for someone playing only their third tournament on grass, with this the Spaniard's first final on the surface.\n\n\"I'm getting better, feeling better every match and right now I feel like I've played for 10 years on grass,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"I didn't expect to adapt my movement and my game so fast on grass and I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nSince losing the opening set in the first round, Alcaraz has looked slick at the tournament and broke Korda's serve twice in the opening set on Saturday, making just one unforced error in the set to take a dominant lead.\n\nHe went an early break ahead in the second and proceeded to curry favour with the London crowd when he hit three outstanding returns over 90mph to break Korda for a second time and go on to serve out the match.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\n'One more to go' for in-form De Minaur\n\nSunday's final will be a first at this tournament for both players but De Minaur boasts more grass experience than his Spanish counterpart.\n\nHaving won at Eastbourne in 2021, De", "standards for players, fans, staff, and everyone in the women's game.\n\u2022 None To restore the talent pathway needed to create future generations of Lionesses.\n\u2022 None Professionalisation across the top two tiers to attract and develop the best players in the world.\n\u2022 None To address the lack of diversity across the women's game - in on- and off-pitch roles.\n\u2022 None The game's governing bodies to work with broadcasters to create a new dedicated time slot.\n\u2022 None More investment in grassroots facilities and better access for females.\n\nCarney, who has worked in the media since her retirement from playing in 2019, was asked to examine issues affecting the game at elite and grassroots levels in September 2022. by the UK government.\n\nThe women's game has made huge progress in recent years and, at grassroots level, has become the most played team sport for women and girls in England, with three million registered players and over 12,000 registered teams.\n\nHowever, both the Covid-19 pandemic and the men's game fan-led review highlighted the shallow resources within women's elite football.\n\nShe appointed a number of experts from across sport and business, including a senior NFL executive, with the UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer calling it an opportunity to \"revolutionise the game\" in a positive and sustainable way.\n\nIn a statement the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Maheta Molango called the report a \"brave, ambitious and detailed plan for the future of women's game\".\n\nAn FA spokeswoman said they would help \"address the challenges and opportunities in the report\" to \"deliver the changes needed\".\n\nThey said: \"These are exciting times for the development of the women's game and we share Karen's vision of creating world leading standards for players, fans, and everyone involved in women's football.\"\n\nWhile the 12-club WSL is fully professional that does not extend to English women's football's second tier.\n\nA significant drop in broadcast fees and FA central funding means that turnovers can be as high as around \u00a37m in the WSL but as low as \u00a3150,000 in the Women's Championship, where player wages can be below \u00a35,000 per year.\n\nReading's recent relegation from the WSL saw them revert to part-time football due to the financial implications.\n\nWhen it was put to Carney that more than \u00a310m would be required to redress some of that balance, she passionately defended the need to attract additional income to the game.\n\n\"Do I want players to have to go on the NHS [for treatment of injuries]? No. Do I want players to have to use bin bags for curtains? No,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want any of this situation any more. There was a lot of evidence in the review of the marketing strategy in place not being able to help the revenues grow.\n\n\"It is what is needed. It is not a negative to invest in women's sport, we have to change the mindset. I understand there is a reality to it.\"\n\nOn proposals to provide one source of funding from levelling FA Cup prize money across the men's and women's game, she added: \"I'd hope there would not be a backlash.\n\n\"There are so many issues and women's sport has struggled for so long I'd hope there'd be an understanding but with anything there'll always be someone who will challenge it.\n\n\"I could have said equalise prize money right now but that would have taken down the pyramid of men's football. We should absolutely be going for equal prize money [in the future] from the FA Cup and the FA should be putting a timescale on that.\"\n\n'Five weeks out can turn into five months' - injury improvements\n\nA long-standing issue that Carney is keen to see addressed urgently is the relative lack of medical support offered to female players in comparison to their male counterparts.\n\nA Fifa report in 2021 showed that a quarter of top-division women's clubs around the world do not employ a physio or team doctor and while there have been improvements Carney says there are still issues around the quality and continuity of care provided.\n\n\"There was a player who should have been out for five weeks and was out five months,\" Carney said.\n\n\"We've seen players pretty much say we are going to have to go into early retirement because of the medical situation. It is a systemic issue about women's health not just in sport but outside, it has to be better.\n\n\"Don't forget in the Championship there are players working three of four jobs. They are never going to be able to compete and it is not because they don't have the ability, it is the resources.\n\n\"Are they hydrated? Are they getting the right nutrients to perform? Are they fatigued? That is why we want minimum standards to come in to keep that competitive nature.\n\n\"We want all our players to be fit, available and playing because then the product is at its best because that's what the fans, broadcasters and players want.\"\n\nFootball's governing bodies have talked of exploring whether WSL fixtures can be televised on Saturday afternoons to help grow the audience.\n\nLast term, WSL matches consistently kicked off at 11.30am on Saturdays and 6.45pm on Sundays to avoid scheduling clashes with men's games.\n\nNo matches are currently shown during the '3pm blackout' slot in order to encourage attendance at games.\n\nHowever, Carney believes there is no simplistic solution: \"It's very clear we need to find a slot specific for women's football.\n\n\"Men's football is really easily signposted, it is really difficult for women's football to have a slot and stand out.\n\n\"We have to look at it, it is a really saturated market and this is what we are up against.\"\n\n'We need to keep pushing' - improving diversity\n\nCarney's 'raising the bar' review also identifies the need to create a workforce strategy for the women's game and the need to create greater diversity on and off the pitch.\n\nFormer Brighton defender Fern Whelan, who is now an equalities executive at the PFA, echoed those comments in response to the report.\n\n\"We can all see that there is a lack of representation across the women's game,\" Whelan said.\n\n\"That isn't by design, or something the game needs to be defensive about. It's something where we've acknowledged there is an issue and begun to take action, but we need to keep pushing.\n\n\"It's positive that the review has highlighted the lack of diversity across the women's game as something that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n\"Are we doing enough to encourage girls and young women from diverse backgrounds into the game? Are we making the professional pathway accessible enough? It's often about practicalities as well as culture.\"\n\nThis is a highly significant moment in English women's football.\n\nThe report has strong backing from the PFA and FifPro, who have worked closely with the review board to ensure players from all backgrounds have been able to share their experiences in confidence.\n\nThere is a range of issues which will need long-term vision and patience to adapt to, but there are also clear short-term recommendations.\n\nAmong the most crucial are improved medical support, calls for fully funded union representation, better prize money and a dedicated WSL broadcast spot - all of which can be addressed immediately.\n\nThere are no legal enforcements given its an independent report, but the simple fact so many have come together to provide a detailed review suggests it will be hard for the likes of the FA - and the WSL takeover company - to ignore.Ukraine found the remains of British World War Two Hurricane aircraft in a forest outside Kyiv\n\nThe rusting remains of eight British Hurricane fighter planes dating back to World War Two have been found buried in a forest in Ukraine.\n\nThe aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union by Britain after Nazi Germany invaded the country in 1941.\n\nThey were part of a package of allied military support for the USSR, paid for by the United States under the so-called Lend-Lease scheme.\n\nSimilar legislation is being used by the US government today to send military aid to Ukraine as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its country.\n\nAviation experts say this is the first time the remains of so many Hurricanes have been found in Ukraine.\n\n\"It is very rare to find this aircraft in Ukraine,\" says Oleks Shtan, a former airline pilot who is leading the excavation", "of the greatest dancers of his era, Nureyev and his family paid a heavy price. He was only allowed back to the USSR more than 25 years later when his mother was dying, while his Soviet friends' careers were made to suffer.\n\nNureyev was one of the greatest dancers of his generation\n\nAfter suffering an ankle injury, Lacotte turned his attention to the archives of the Paris Opera from 1968.\n\nThey included La Sylphide, the first ballet performed completely \"en pointe\" - where the dancers stand on the tip of their toes - when it was first produced in 1832.\n\nHis final work in 2021 was a production of The Red and the Black based on the 1830 novel by French writer Stendhal.\n\nDespite being 91 he was still working, his wife said.\n\n\"It's very sad.

There had been a dispute and the Council had been seeking to resolve that in good faith, but the two board members were reluctant to engage in those discussions. \"\n\nShe would not discuss the details of the dispute but added: \"We have been doing our best to work constructively. We haven't found compatibility through this framework.\"\n\nISB was part of the Church's response to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse report in 2020, which found the Church of England was a \"hiding place for abusers\".\n\nAsked if there were still places where abusers can hide in the Church, Mrs Coulter paused and said: \"I can't with my hand on my heart say there isn't, but I do know\u2026 we want the church to be a safe place for everyone.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph last month, Ms Sanghera -who founded a charity supporting forced marriage victims - and Mr Reeves - a specialist in abuse in organisations - raised the alarm over \"interference\" with their work.\n\nThey also raised their objections to the appointment of Meg Munn as acting chairwoman of their three-strong board.\n\nFormer MP Ms Munn has been the independent chairwoman of the Church's National Safeguarding Panel for the past five years. Although her new role has been ended, she has been asked by the Church to continue in an interim role to provide \"business continuity\".\n\nMr Reeves tweeted on Thursday: \"It's overwhelming to see people standing up for independence in safeguarding. It's been humbling to receive all the messages, in the hundreds now, expressing support for the work that Jas Sanghera and I have been doing - with the support of so many others - recently.\n\nMs Sanghera tweeted: \"We have not been removed because of a breakdown in relationships.

I was able to lever its jaws open just far enough to get my head out,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe crocodile - suspected to be a juvenile - came back for another go, he said, but he was able to push it away, suffering a bite to his hand.\n\nQueensland's environment department says it will investigate the incident, but \"crocodiles in the open ocean can be difficult to locate as the animals often travel tens of kilometres per day\".\n\nHaggerstone Island Resort describes itself as a \"family-owned, exclusive luxury resort\". The entire island, some 600km north of Cairns, is available for hire at $7,600 (\u00a34,063; $US4,979) a night.\n\nCrocodiles are common in Australia's tropical north, which has seen a series of attacks recently.\n\nIn February, rangers shot a 4.2m (13.4ft) crocodile that attacked a man and ate his dog at a remote boat ramp north of Cairns.\n\nAnd earlier this month, the remains of 65-year-old fisherman Kevin Darmody were found inside a 4.1m crocodile on the nearby Kennedy River - the 13th fatal attack in Queensland since record-keeping began in 1985.\n\nUnder Queensland's management programme, \"problem crocodiles\" are removed from areas where they threaten public safety and, in rare instances, euthanised.\n\nSince crocodile hunting was banned in 1974, the state's crocodile population has rebounded from a low of some 5,000 animals to around 30,000 today.The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary group has vowed to \"go all the way\" to topple Russia's military leadership, hours after the Kremlin accused him of \"armed rebellion\".\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin said his Wagner fighters had crossed the border from Ukraine into Russia, entering the city of Rostov-on-Don.\n\nMr Prigozhin said his men would destroy anyone who stood in their way.\n\nThe local governor urged citizens there to keep calm and stay indoors.\n\nMr Prigozhin claimed that his forces had shot down a Russian military helicopter that \"opened fire on a civilian convoy\". He did not give a location and the assertion could not be immediately verified.\n\nThe Wagner Group is a private army of mercenaries that has been fighting alongside the regular Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nTension has been growing between them over how the war has been fought, with Mr Prigozhin launching vocal criticisms of Russia's military leadership in recent months.\n\nOn Friday, the 62-year-old mercenary leader accused the military of launching a deadly missile strike on his troops and vowed to punish them. He did not provide evidence.\n\nAuthorities have denied the strike and demanded he halt his \"illegal actions\".\n\nMr Prigozhin said the \"evil\" in Russia's military leadership must be stopped and vowed to \"march for justice\".\n\n\"Those who killed our lads, and tens of thousands of lives of Russian soldiers [in the war in Ukraine] will be punished,\" he said in an audio message posted to the social media platform Telegram.\n\n\"I ask you not to resist.

But there's doubt again now.\n\nThis season has not been the Celtic procession that some might have thought it was going to be. Rangers have got their act together while Celtic have bobbed along on choppy waters.\n\nA poor summer transfer window followed by a poor January transfer window. The sound of booing at Celtic Park. The sound of Rodgers having a go at those booing. The endless grief with the Green Brigade. The \"good girl\" saga that saw Rodgers slammed by a women's campaigning group. The Scottish FA charge - and subsequent touchline ban - for accusing officials of incompetence.\n\nIt's been a grind. Five draws and three defeats. Ninetieth-minute wins against Hibs and Motherwell twice. It wasn't supposed to be like this for the prodigal son.\n\nAnd yet, they're still top of the league, albeit with Rangers having a game in hand.\n\nThey've scored more goals than their city rivals, have a higher expected goals count and have created more big chances.\n\nThey've not been fluent nearly as often as Rodgers would have liked - he's had some harsh words to say about their negativity and their lack of speed of thought and movement along the way - but they're still there.\n\nAnd if they win, or even draw, on Sunday you'd make them favourites to win the title because they'll have Rangers at Celtic Park post-split, a Celtic Park that will be heaving to the sound of 60,000 fans getting on the backs of visiting players, many of whom have never closed a deal as big as this one.\n\nRangers will be encouraged by Callum McGregor's absence since the end of February and hopeful that, even if he is ready to play, then he won't be at his totemic best.\n\nFor Rodgers, it's bigger this time. He has never faced this kind of game in Scotland before, a game that if lost could - and most probably would - cost him the title.\n\nThat's alien territory for the Celtic manager. In his previous incarnation they'd have been organising the party by now.\n\nIt's what makes Sunday so intoxicating. Rodgers, and how he will be viewed by Celtic fans in victory or in defeat, is a drama unto itself. Given their complicated feelings about him, it's a love-in or a pile-on balanced on a knife edge.\n\nAll 15 of his Old Firm games have been important, but this one holds more peril than any of the others.\n\nHave your say on Rodgers & Celtic\n\nIf the form doesn't load properly, go straight to it here...\n\u2022 Celtic is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Celtic - go straight to all the best contentThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMartin Lewis said he was left feeling \"sick\" by an online scam video featuring a realistic computer-generated likeness of him.\n\nThe widely-circulated ad, which attempts to solicit money for a supposed investment scheme, appears to use AI-powered deepfake technology.\n\nConsumer finance expert Lewis said it was \"weird and pretty frightening\" to have his face and voice imitated.\n\nHe warned people would be tricked out of money without industry regulation.\n\nIn the advert - which appeared on Facebook - a fake likeness of Lewis encourages people to sign up for what is claimed to be an Elon Musk-backed project, calling it \"legit\" and a \"great investment\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lewis said: \"My name and face have been the subject of scam adverts for many years, I get countless reports every day.\n\n\"This is the first deepfake I've seen with me in it\u2026 it's already difficult enough to persuade people [about scams].\n\n\"I've had friends of mine get in touch with me at times saying 'hey, I've just put some money in that investment scheme you're advertising'.\n\nDeepfakes are images which have been convincingly digitally manipulated.

Some \u00a3740,000 was raised through \"independence related appeals\", the accounts stated.\n\nHowever, the party has spent a total of \u00a35,259,805, meaning it made a loss of about \u00a3750,000 over the year.

Three other members of the SNP's finance committee also resigned.\n\nMr Chapman's decision to stand down was understood to be linked to a row about the use of \u00a3600,000 which was raised by activists who were told it would be ringfenced for a second independence referendum.\n\nPolice Scotland recently confirmed that its investigation into what happened to the money was ongoing.

When they arrived I noticed one of them was carrying a Sainsbury's carrier bag,\" Ms Reid said.\n\nInside the carrier bag was a six-inch box containing samples taken from Gary which had been used in tests without her permission.\n\n\"It knocked me for six and was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life,\" Ms Reid said.\n\n\"I was so shocked and said 'How dare you. That is the only parts of my son I have and you want to hand them to me in a carrier bag?'\n\n\"I was absolutely horrified. When I told my son, Steven, he was dumbfounded.\"\n\nThe officials then took the remains back and they were sent to the undertaker.\n\nThe exhumed coffin in 2017, which was not prepared by NHS Lothian, contained items including a shroud and a cross\n\nAn NHS Lothian spokeswoman denied Ms Reid's claim that she was asked to look inside the box by the officials.\n\nTracey Gillies, medical director for NHS Lothian said: \"I would like to repeat publicly the apology we made to Ms Reid in person for the upset and distress this has caused.\n\n\"The samples that formed part of the investigation were placed in a dignity wooden casket to be returned to Ms Reid while she was in hospital.\n\n\"This was then placed within a plastic bag to avoid drawing attention as they walked through the hospital.\n\n\"We are sincerely sorry for the additional distress this caused.

Russian soldiers came by only once, she says.\n\nShe never, for a second, considered leaving the village.\n\nThe artillery barrage over, we leave through a lane at the end of her house. Three Russian corpses lie in a ditch, just beyond Nina Fedorivna's vegetable patch. A truck with the Z symbol, which was used by Russian forces, sits nearby riddled with bullet and shrapnel holes. The fighting here was at close quarters.\n\nThroughout the village roses are in bloom - but the smell of corpses catches the back of your throat.\n\nThere's no time to delay - the soldiers have an air of concentration and purpose. They are clearly preparing for something.\n\nThey head east, leaving Blahodatne behind. The two-car convoy is well spaced in case of Russian attack. The fields around are heavily mined, poles with red-and-white ribbon mark cleared ground.\n\nAs we get close to another abandoned American armoured vehicle, there's an explosion, just missing the wreckage. It is likely from a Russian drone.\n\nI was in this area back in March. Then, the front lines had barely moved a few metres in months. Russia was using far more artillery than Ukrainian forces, who mainly hunkered down in trenches waiting for the barrages to end. At the time, a commander told me they were conserving their shells for the counter-offensive. On this visit, Ukrainian guns didn't stop for the two days I was with the brigade.\n\nThe cars speed on to a network of trenches hidden in a line of trees. There, company commander, Senior Sergeant Andrii Onistrat, 49, runs his men through their next mission - a Ukrainian assault is planned for the next day on the Russian trenches, 3km (1.8 miles) away at the foot of the low hills to the south.\n\nIn their attempt to widen the front, sections of the 68th Brigade will attack from the countryside east of Blahodatne and Makarivka, across minefields and directly in the line of Russian fire.\n\nSgt Onistrat runs through the drone team's communication protocols and targets. The section loses as many as five drones a day. Tanned and with a brilliant white grin, he looks at his grim-faced men and gives one final order: \"Smile - why are you so serious? We are winning the war.\"\n\nSmile, why are you so serious? We are winning the war\n\nTwenty-four hours later, most of the same men are in a sweltering dugout. The attack is under way.\n\nFrom their surveillance cameras I can see two armoured vehicles slowly making their way through the minefield. Drone after drone is sent above the Russian positions dropping smoke grenades, creating a smoke screen along the Russian-occupied trenches to allow vehicles to advance and confuse enemy anti-tank weapons. As I watch, Ukrainian shells repeatedly strike the treeline.\n\nYuri, a young soldier, runs in and out of the dugout, changing drone batteries and sending them into flight, while voices bark orders and target positions across the radios. Mosquitoes and horseflies are feasting on the men, but still \"Frisbee\", from western Ukraine, has taken his shirt off because of the heat.\n\nTheir enemy isn't holding back. As I stand outside, a Russian strike lands close enough to throw dirt into the trench. Standing lookout in wrap-around shades and without body armour is Zheka.\n\nAnother Russian shell lands close and I hit the ground. I look up and Zheka hasn't flinched. He shouts in English - expletives directed at the Russians - and gives two middle fingers to the air. Salvoes of Grad rockets rain down on Ukrainian positions.\n\nUkrainian forces launch drones to drop smoke grenades near the Russian positions\n\nMore broadly, the counter-offensive is made more difficult because of the lack of Ukrainian air power. The West has promised F-16 fighter planes, but they will not arrive until later this year.\n\nBack outside in the trenches, another soldier, Yaroslav, explains: \"Russian helicopters, Russians jets fire at every area, every day\". He's interrupted as another strike lands nearby. \"Go to the shelter, good luck,\" he says.\n\nWhen, on 3 June, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine was ready for the counter-offensive, he mentioned Russian air superiority and warned many Ukrainian lives would be lost. And so it has been for the 68th Brigade.\n\nSgt Onistrat says this weighs heavily on him. \"The severity of the day depends solely on one thing - the number of people we lose. The last week has been extremely difficult. We have lost a large number of people.\"\n\nOn his head he wears a ballistic helmet, a size too small. I mention it and he starts to weep. \"It was my son's,\" he says.\n\nOstap Onistrat, 21, was killed in a drone strike not far from where we speak, a couple of days before the counter-offensive began. He'd been in the army a year.\n\nHis father is still in the throes of grief. \"A kamikaze drone flew to them and in fact hit him directly. It was impossible to recognise him. He was buried in a closed coffin,\" Sgt Onistrat says.\n\nSgt Onistrat lost his son Ostap (right) just days before the counter-offensive began\n\nHow does he go on, I ask. \"I made a commitment. You know, we're here to win. Not to sit back, not to escape. I just think that every person here must do their job professionally. There is nothing heroic in it. I just have to finish this job.\"\n\nWhen I ask if he's looking for revenge, he replies firmly: \"Revenge is a sin.\n\n\"My task is to bring this story to an end. I want to take part in the victory parade. I want us to win, and I want to lose fewer people.\"\n\nWe leave the front, the offensive still under way. Later, I received a message telling me they'd taken the Russian positions.\n\nReturning to the command post, Sgt Onistrat's car escorting us swerves and comes to a sudden stop. He, along with others, quickly exits the vehicle. I wonder if we too need to take cover.\n\nThen I see what's caught their attention - cherry trees.\n\nLike kids, they laugh carefree for a moment as they grab handfuls of the dark red fruit from the shady branches, as artillery and mortar fire continues to hammer Russian positions on the hillside.It was delivered by Suella Braverman, but this was un", "ting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.\n\n\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"\n\nWhen interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments.\n\nThe increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.\n\nThis comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.\n\nIf the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.\n\nEight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers or anyone seeking to remortgage face a sharp rise in repayments when they move on to a new deal.\n\nThe so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.\n\nRenters are also feeling the impact. \"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.\n\nRents have been growing faster than wages in the UK for nearly two years, according to exclusive data given to the BBC by property portal Zoopla.\n\nMeanwhile, savers should benefit from a rise in interest rates, but MPs on the Treasury Committee have criticised banks and building societies for failing to pass this on in full to loyal savers who have instant-access savings accounts.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEnergy providers are warning Americans to be frugal with air-conditioning this weekend, as intense heat and increased demand could lead to blackouts.\n\nNearly 200 million Americans are under \"dangerously hot conditions\" alerts with temperatures expected to soar past 100F (38C) in several major cities.\n\nJuly is expected to be Earth's hottest month since record keeping began.\n\nPJM Interconnection, the company in charge of power supply in 13 states and Washington DC, warned that \"extreme heat and/or humidity may cause capacity problems on the grid\".\n\n\"Temperatures are expected to go above 90F (32\u00b0C) across the footprint, which drives up the demand for electricity,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn New York, where the heat index - how hot it feels - is expected to climb as high as 110F, energy provider Con Edison is telling residents to reduce energy usage at home to help avert shutoffs.\n\n\"Intense heat and increased demand for air conditioning can cause strain on the electric system and may lead to localised outages,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe city is keeping swimming pools open longer and pointing New Yorkers to dozens of cooling centres for those without air-conditioning.\n\nGrid operators across the country declared hot weather alerts this week and told energy companies to put off unnecessary maintenance so all available generating plants and power lines would be ready for service.\n\nAccording to the most recent results from the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, 88% of US households use air conditioning.\n\nIn New York, the heat index is expected to climb as high as 110F\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that the sweltering heat will \"engulf much of the eastern half of the US\".\n\nWeekend could bring the hottest days of summer so far for millions of people from coastal Virginia through Washington DC, where heat indexes are also expected to surpass 110F.\n\nMany places are set to surpass their temperature records for daytime highs as well as warm night time lows through Saturday morning, the NWS said.\n\nThe southern US has already been baking under sweltering heat this past month. On Thursday, the city of Phoenix, Arizona marked the most consecutive days per year - 15 - with temperatures above 115F. It was also the city's 28th day in a row with a temperature of at least 110\u00b0F, well past the previous record of 18 days set in 1974.\n\nOn top of the heat, parts of the Midwest face a threat of flash flooding from severe thunderstorms that are expected over parts of the Great Lakes into the Mid-Missouri Valley, according to the NWS.\n\nThere are a number of steps to take to stay safe in extreme heat, including drinking lots of water, staying indoors or in the shade, using fans and ice cold showers to cool off, experts say.\n\nThe Biden administration announced a number of measures this week to try to tackle the extreme temperatures hitting the US, including protections for workers who are the most vulnerable to heat.\n\nHuman-induced climate change has made heatwaves more frequent, more intense and longer-lasting.

Watch: Lisa Telling said Ruth knew her school's Ofsted result for 54 days but couldn't tell her staff\n\nStopping school inspections in England would be \"against children's best interests\", Ofsted's chief has said.\n\nTeachers have called for them to be paused, after head teacher Ruth Perry took her own life while waiting for a report that downgraded her school from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\".\n\nAmanda Spielman said inspections are important for both schools and parents.\n\nIt comes as the BBC can reveal Ms Perry had been \"delighted\" with feedback from Ofsted in an informal visit in 2019.\n\nInspectors had visited Caversham Primary School as part of a programme of informal visits to pilot a new inspection framework.\n\nOfsted has confirmed to the BBC's education editor Branwen Jeffreys that Ms Spielman attended in person to observe the visit.\n\nIn a newsletter to parents at the time, Ms Perry said she was \"incredibly proud\" of how well pupils and staff responded to the experience, adding that the feedback had been \"overwhelmingly positive\".\n\nBut after a formal inspection in November 2022, Ms Perry's school was rated as inadequate as a result of failings in training, record-keeping and checks on staff. The Ofsted report added that Caversham Primary School provided a good education and a welcoming and vibrant community for children.\n\nFollowing Ms Perry's death, Ms Spielman has said a debate about reforming inspections to remove grades was a \"legitimate one\", but added that any changes to the system \"would have to meet the needs both of parents and of government\".\n\nOfsted inspectors give ratings of either outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate.\n\nMs Spielman said those ratings \"give parents a simple and accessible summary of a school's strengths and weaknesses\".\n\nBut Paul Gosling, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the one-word assessments were too simplistic to sum up the complexity of school life.\n\nMs Perry's family has said her death was a \"direct result of the pressure\" caused by the school inspection.\n\nLisa Telling, a head teacher in Reading who knew Ms Perry well, said she had been under \"enormous stress\" and \"knew the outcome of her report but was unable to tell her staff\".\n\n\"As a head teacher, when you get your result and your final feedback, currently the system does not allow you to share that. That's a huge piece of information to hold on to,\" she said.\n\nOfsted's handbook says school leaders can share the provisional findings of inspections with those responsible for the governance of the school, as long as they are marked as confidential and subject to change.\n\nMrs Telling told BBC Breakfast that Ms Perry was restricted from sharing the \"world-destroying\" verdict for 54 days before she died.\n\nMr Gosling said school leaders should be allowed to speak to \"a range of people who might be able to support them\" if they were concerned by an Ofsted result.\n\nRuth Perry was the head at Caversham Primary School in Reading\n\nSince Ms Perry's death, some head teachers have removed references to Ofsted from websites, job adverts and letters.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the National Education Union handed a petition to the government calling for Ofsted to be replaced.\n\nIn Reading, headteachers' groups have written to the government asking for an urgent review of the system.\n\nMs Spielman said it would be wrong to say too much ahead of the coroner's inquest.\n\n\"Our school inspectors are all former or serving school leaders,\" she added. \"They understand the vital work head teachers do and the pressures they are under.\"\n\nSome head teachers, including Flora Cooper from Berkshire, are wearing black armbands during school inspections, following Ms Perry's suicide\n\nMs Spielman acknowledged inspections \"can be challenging\" but said inspectors always aimed to conduct them \"with sensitivity as well as professionalism\".\n\nBut school improvement adviser Julie Price-Grimshaw said that was \"definitely not the case\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC 5 Live Breakfast, she said many head teachers were getting \"very ill, stressed and having breakdowns\" as a result of inspections.\n\nMs Price-Grimshaw, who used to be an Ofsted inspector, said it was \"impossible for teachers and head teachers to raise standards if they're feeling broken, demoralised, stressed and anxious\".\n\nBut one vice-principal, at a secondary school in West Yorkshire, said Ofsted inspectors \"came across as human and had collaborative conversations with staff\", during a recent visit.\n\nHe said the inspection process was \"intense and extremely stressful\", but added that it resulted in an \"honest reflection of where our school is at\".\n\nMs Spielman said Ofsted aimed \"to make inspections as collaborative and constructive as we can\" and would remain focused on improving how it worked with schools, and \"how inspections feel for school staff", "Lawrence murder investigation.\n\nThe investigation, which was carried out by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on behalf of the IOPC, followed an official review by barrister Mark Ellison KC, which said there were outstanding lines of inquiry into allegations that Mr Davidson was in a corrupt relationship with the father of David Norris, one of Stephen's killers.\n\nThe claims were made by Mr Davidson's former colleague, Neil Putnam, a corrupt officer turned super-grass.\n\nMr Putnam, who did not work on the Lawrence murder inquiry, alleged that Mr Davidson had admitted the corrupt relationship to him. Davidson denied the claims.\n\nJohn Davidson was told in 2019 that he was no longer under investigation because there was no evidence of corruption on his part in relation to the Stephen Lawrence case.\n\nThe NCA then investigated Mr Putnam and passed a file to the CPS to consider whether he should be charged with perjury or perverting the course of justice. The CPS has decided he will not be charged.\n\nThe IOPC investigation ended up focusing on the four senior officers from the first murder investigation, and their handling of the early part of the case.\n\nIn 2020, the IOPC passed a file of evidence to the CPS, which was asked to consider whether they may have committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe criminal offence of misconduct in public office is committed when the office holder acts - or fails to act - in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office.\n\nLast week a BBC investigation identified a sixth suspect in the murder and exposed a series of police failings in relation to him.\n\nNew evidence about the murder of Stephen Lawrence, uncovered by BBC investigative reporter, Daniel De Simone.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Women workers are vital to UN humanitarian aid operations in Afghanistan\n\nThe United Nations head has strongly condemned a Taliban ban on Afghan women working for the organisation.\n\nSecretary General Antonio Guterres demanded Afghanistan's rulers immediately revoke the order, saying it was discriminatory and breached international human rights law.\n\nFemale staff were \"essential for UN operations\" in the country, he said.\n\nThe Taliban have increasingly restricted women's freedoms since seizing power in 2021.\n\nThere was no immediate word from their government on why the order had been issued. Foreign female UN workers are exempt.\n\nThe UN has been working to bring humanitarian aid to 23 million people in Afghanistan, which is reeling from a severe economic and humanitarian crisis. Female workers play a vital role in on-the-ground aid operations, particularly in identifying other women in need.\n\n\"Female staff members are essential for the United Nations operations, including in the delivery of life-saving assistance,\" Secretary General Mr Guterres said in a statement.\n\n\"The enforcement of this decision will harm the Afghan people, millions of whom are in need of this assistance.\"\n\nHe called on the Taliban to \"reverse all measures that restrict women's and girls' rights to work, education and freedom of movement\".\n\nEarlier, the UN told its Afghan staff - men and women - not to report to work while it sought clarity from the Taliban. Local women had been stopped from going to work at UN facilities in eastern Nangarhar province on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN mission had been exempt from a previous Taliban ban issued in December that stopped all NGOs using women staff unless they were health workers.\n\nHow health programmes in the country will be affected by the ban on UN staff remains unclear.\n\nThe ban is being seen as the most significant test of the future of UN operations in Afghanistan, and the relationship between the organisation and the Taliban government, which is not recognised anywhere in the world.\n\nSince the Taliban's return to power, teenage girls and women have been barred from schools, colleges and universities. Women are required to be dressed in a way that only reveals their eyes, and must be accompanied by a male relative if they are travelling more than 72km (48 miles).\n\nAnd last November, women were banned from parks, gyms and swimming pools, stripping away the simplest of freedoms.\n\nThe Taliban have also cracked down on advocates for female education. Last month, Matiullah Wesa, a prominent Afghan campaigner for female education, was arrested for unknown reasons.\n\nIn February Professor Ismail Mashal, an outspoken critic of the Taliban government's ban on education for women, was also arrested in Kabul while handing out free books.A burial crypt close to the final resting place of Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe has sold for $195,000 (\u00a3154,443) at auction.\n\nBeverley Hills tech investor Anthony Jabin said he had \"always dreamt\" of being next to Monroe.\n\nThe space is also close to the crypt of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who bought the vault next to Monroe's in 1992.\n\nFans of Monroe, who died in 1962 at the age of 36, regularly visit her crypt in Los Angeles, California.\n\nShe starred in some of the biggest Hollywood films of her era, including Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Some Like It Hot and How to Marry a Millionaire.\n\nSince her death, she has continued to be the subject of fascination for many.\n\nItems of hers were sold alongside former possessions of Hefner's - who was the founder of Playboy and was accused of coercing and drugging women into sex after his death in 2017 - at an auction titled Icons: Playboy, Hugh Hefner, and Marilyn Monroe, run by Julien's Auctions.\n\nAlong with the crypt space, Mr Jabin also purchased a swimming costume that once belonged to Monroe, as well as Hefner's old bed.\n\nOther notable items sold at the auction included a pink silk Pucci dress belonging to Monroe, which sold for the highest sum of $325,000.\n\nA used Elizabeth Arden lipstick belonging to the actress also raised $65,000.\n\nItems of Hefner's sold included one of his trademark smoking jackets, which went for $13,000 in a bundle with a pair of his slippers, pyjamas and a tobacco pipe.\n\nArtwork that once hung in the Playboy headquarters was also sold.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Watch as LeBron James becomes only the second player, after Michael Jordan, to score 40 points in more than one NBA game after the age of 39 following the Los Angeles Lakers' 116-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAvailable to UK users only.Gwyn has been cleaning trains for 25 years\n\nAn 80-year-old train cleaner who works shifts until the early hours of the morning says he loves his job - and has no plans to retire just yet.\n\nWilliam Gwyn Thomas, who used to be a dairy farmer in Lampeter, Ceredigion, has been cleaning trains at Carmarthen station for 25 years.\n\nGwyn, as he prefers to be known, works with a team to clean anywhere between 18 and 26 carriages a night.\n\n\"I didn't expect I'd still be working at 80,\" said Gwyn.\n\n\"But I really love it, and I'll finish when I'm ready and when I feel I can't do it as well.\"\n\nGwyn -

which outlined its case against her - some months after her disappearance.\n\nThe inquest was also told that Caddick had a life insurance policy, which included suicide cover, and had made a number of references to ending her life over the years - but police initially devoted limited resources to this line of inquiry.\n\nMagistrate Ryan on Thursday said the uncovering of Caddick's deception may have triggered a \"narcissistic injury\", with the illusion of her wealth and success shattered.\n\n\"The Asic investigation and search warrant very likely caused her a catastrophic level of shame and despair,\" she said.\n\n\"She may well have reached the conclusion that ending her life was the only option.\"\n\nBut the manner of her death will ultimately remain unresolved, she said.\n\nEqually unresolved are the losses of her clients, many of whom saw huge sums of money vanish.\n\n\"I sold my business as I was under the impression my money was safe, and I retired in 2017,\" one victim testified.\n\n\"To rub more salt in the wound she has also stolen my mother's money, wife's, mother-in-law, son, brother and sister\u2026 wiping out three generations of my family's savings.\"Kate Forbes, who finished second to Humza Yousaf in the SNP leadership race, has announced that she is leaving the Scottish government.\n\nScotland's finance secretary was on maternity leave after the birth of her daughter when Nicola Sturgeon suddenly announced that she was quitting as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister.\n\nWithin a couple of days of confirming she would be standing in the contest to succeed her, Ms Forbes found herself at the centre of a political storm.\n\nHer views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, trans rights and having children outside of marriage were savaged by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who had been standing in for the deeply religious Ms Forbes since last July.\n\nMs Sturgeon herself also made thinly-veiled barbs at the woman she had appointed finance secretary at the age of 29, just hours before she had to deliver a budget speech.\n\nScotland is a progressive country, Ms Sturgeon stated, and the views of the next first minister therefore matter.\n\nMs Forbes saw several supporters desert her campaign in response to the furore, which was ignited when she told journalists that she would not have voted for gay marriage had she been an MSP at the time.\n\nShe subsequently told Sky News that she believed that having children outside of marriage is \"wrong\" according to her faith as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, while stressing that: \"In a free society you can do what you want.\"\n\nMs Forbes has never hidden her religious beliefs, leaving pundits wondering why they had appeared to come as a shock to some of her supporters.\n\nThe Free Church, of which she is a devout follower, has strongly opposed gay marriage since it was legalised in Scotland in 2014.\n\nMs Forbes and her husband Ali celebrated the birth of daughter Naomi last year\n\nIn 2018, Ms Forbes spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland a day after a Westminster debate on abortion, when she called on politicians to \"recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\n\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\n\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.\n\nSeveral senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.\n\nHumza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to \"progressive values\" and avoids a \"lurch to the right\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.\n\nMs Forbes told Mr Yousaf: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.\n\n\"What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?\"\n\nMs Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity\".\n\nThe remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the \"continuity candidate\", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.\n\nShe later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.\n\nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.\n\nHer parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was \"just down the road\".\n\nMs Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood\n\nShe went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.\n\nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nShe went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.\n\nShe worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace him when he stood down.\n\nOn the backbenches, the then 26-year-old campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic.\n\nIn 2018 she entered government as public finance minister working alongside Derek Mackay, who she would go on to succeed as finance secretary when he was forced to stand down just hours before delivering his budget speech after it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.\n\nMs Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice, having only received the call from Ms Sturgeon at 7am that morning.\n\nShe has said the SNP needs to win over No voters by using the Scottish Parliament's existing powers to show that Scotland can flourish if it is to secure independence.\n\nMs Forbes had only a few hours to prepare for a budget speech after being appointed to the finance brief\n\nMs Forbes told the Guardian: \"We keep holding ourselves as hostages to fortune by setting a timetable rather than by focusing on what is really going to shift the dial.\n\n\"So day one, I would start the campaign", "in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.\n\nUNRWA called for a \"complete reversal in policies\" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.The victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning\n\nPolice say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.\n\nOfficers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.\n\nIt came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.\n\nSeven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.\n\nDet Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: \"This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.\n\n\"I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.This is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.\n\nI have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.\n\nAnd quite some growing it's had to do.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak became prime minister, President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nCore to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.\n\nLittle wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what he made of Prince Harry's remarks that the UK is judged globally by the state of the press and the government - both of which the prince reckons are at \"rock bottom.\"\n\nBut, having tried to prove he can be the gentle jazz of politics rather than the heavy metal that came before, the challenge for Rishi Sunak now is delivery, and quickly, with a general election expected next year.\n\nUkraine will be a recurring theme on this trip.\n\nMr Sunak has told us the UK is looking into who was to blame for the destruction of the huge dam there.\n\nHe said it was too soon to make \"a definitive judgement.\"\n\nBut, he added, if it was intentional, it would represent \"the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.\"\n\nThe UK and US's ongoing support for Kyiv will be central to the discussions between the leaders at the White House on Thursday.\n\nRishi Sunak and Joe Biden met in Japan, last month\n\nAlso on the agenda, the regulation of artificial intelligence and economic cooperation.\n\nOn AI, the prime minister is expected to make the case that the UK can be a global leader on its development and regulation.\n\nAnd on the economy, Rishi Sunak has said he will \"continue discussing\" America's Inflation Reduction Act - which has seen billions in new subsidies targeted at green industries in the US - with some fretting the UK is being left behind.\n\nYou can read more about it here from my colleague Faisal Islam.\n\nThe gulf between the president and the prime minister's instincts on this is wide, if not surprising: a Democratic president opting for massive state intervention, in the hope of greening his economy, reviving left behind areas and bringing manufacturing back to the US.\n\nAnd a Conservative prime minister not naturally drawn towards huge interventions like this - and suggesting \"subsidy races,\" as he put it, were a \"zero sum\" game.\n\nBut even if there is a philosophical opposition from some to what the president is doing, what are the political responses to it?\n\nRishi Sunak said \"we've created lots of jobs\" in green industries and \"reduced carbon faster\" than comparable countries.\n\nHe doesn't believe attempting the same plan as Washington would be wise.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel Reeves - who hopes to become the UK's first ever female chancellor if Labour win the next election - was in the US capital just a few weeks ago, and openly embracing a strategy very similar to Joe Biden's.\n\nIs her plan affordable, and achievable? They are big and, as yet, unanswered questions.\n\nWhat is much clearer is President Biden's attempts to rewire the global economy has implications all over the place - not least on our own domestic economy - and politics.The death of a 43-year-old man is the first in the UK to be linked to the \"zombie\" drug xylazine, which is prompting overdose warnings in the US.\n\nNormally used as a large-animal tranquiliser but now being found in heroin, it can cause a dangerously low heart rate and large open skin wounds.\n\nUK experts are calling it \"a really concerning drug\".\n\nThey say drug users should be warned it is now present in the UK but there is no safe dose in humans.\n\nKarl Warburton, form Solihull, West Midlands, died in May 2022 at home and had a history of illicit drug use, according to the coroner's report. He had been referred to addiction services on a number of occasions.\n\nAn examination of his body detected heroin, fentanyl and cocaine in his system, as well as xylazine.\n\nA report on his death in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine says he was \"likely to have bought heroin and not known it was laced with xylazine and fentanyl\".\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first death associated with xylazine use reported in the UK, and even Europe, and indicates the entry of xylazine into the UK drug supply,\" it adds.\n\nXylazine is used by vets as a powerful sedative but it's not approved for use in humans.\n\nKnown as \"tranq\" or \"tranq dope\" when cut with heroin and fentanyl by drug dealers, xylazine has been causing huge problems in the US.\n\nIf injected directly into someone's bloodstream, it can cause large open skin ulcers to form. These can start to rot and lead to amputation.\n\nIt also lowers breathing and heart rate to dangerously low levels, which has led to it being dubbed a \"flesh-eating zombie drug\".\n\nXylazine emerged on the illicit drug market in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s and has since been found in the US, mainly in the east, and in Canada.\n\nThe US government has called it \"an emerging threat\" because of its growing role in fatal overdoses across the country - about 7% of the total.\n\nAnd in some states, the drug was found in more than a quarter of overdoses.\n\nBut until now, there has been no sign of xylazine in the UK.\n\nThe drug was detected only because the Birmingham lab that carried out tests after the man's death noticed some strange results and identified xylaxine.\n\n\"The drug is not included in standard drug screens in the UK, so we don't know how widespread the xylazine problem is,\" said Dr Caroline Copeland, King's College London lecturer and director of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths.\n\n\"We need to find out how that person ended up with it in his system.\"\n\nXylazine was listed on the man's death certificate as contributing to his death but there was no way of recording it in the UK drug-deaths database.\n\nThe report highlights the need to monitor changes in illicit-drug markets and in emerging drugs.\n\n\"There is no safe dose to use\", it concludes, because there is an overlap between fatal and non-fatal doses of xylazine reported in people.James Gallagher wired up for the heatwave experiment\n\nSometimes it can feel like the world is on fire.\n\nEurope has been baking in a heatwave nicknamed the settimana infernale - \"week of hell\" - in Italy. Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just", "of the state capitol, Des Moines.\n\nThe day after the attack, police found the mother-of-three's body hidden under a tarpaulin, wheelbarrow and railway sleepers in a local park where she used to walk after school.\n\nIn a police interview, Miller described frustrations with the way Ms Graber taught Spanish.\n\nHe said his marks in her class were lowering his Grade Point Average, an important score during applications for US colleges and scholarships.\n\nMiller met Ms Graber at Fairfield High School on the day of the murder to discuss his poor grade in her class. Goodale was also a student there.\n\nMexican-born Ms Graber had been employed at the school since 2012. She was part of the town's small but growing Latino community.Chris Heaton-Harris says the UK government now has more clarity on DUP demands\n\nSecretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris has said he is \"very hopeful\" that the Stormont executive will return in the autumn.\n\nHe said he believed a resolution of the difficulties was \"getting much closer\".\n\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill said she did not hear any urgency on the part of the UK government to restore Stormont during her talks.\n\nThe DUP has insisted new legislation is needed before it will end its 18-month boycott over post-Brexit trade rules.\n\nThe party walked out of Stormont's power-sharing executive in February 2022 in protest over a Brexit deal which introduced new checks and restrictions on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary was speaking after holding a series of talks with the main political parties this week.\n\nHe said new legislation may be required at Westminster and the government now has \"a lot more clarity\" about what the DUP is seeking.\n\nSpeaking after her meeting at Hillsborough Castle on Thursday, Ms O'Neill said she made it clear to the secretary of state that the current political vacuum at Stormont was \"totally unsustainable\".\n\n\"All it is serving is to punish the public,\" she said.\n\n\"Whilst people in the DUP take themselves off on summer holidays, families are left struggling; workers and families are left struggling and worried about how they are going to deal with the cost of living.\"\n\nIf you'd asked me where we're at earlier today I would have said in a very bad place, but that's before we heard the optimism pouring out of Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nHe, let's face it, is in a better position to know than us.\n\nLet us see what happens in September before popping any Champagne corks.\n\nWe have to see what the DUP says, because no matter how much people don't like it, there will be no deal unless the DUP says there's a deal.\n\nWe are certainly not there yet.\n\nEarlier, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie predicted the executive would be restored by the autumn.\n\nMr Beattie said his delegation had \"a good conversation\" with the secretary of state at Hillsborough Castle but said he was a realist and admitted that \"the timings are getting tight\".\n\nMr Beattie said there would be a couple of weeks in September when a decision would have to be made and insisted \"that's down to the DUP\".\n\nThe UUP's Robbie Butler and Doug Beattie also met the NI secretary at Hillsborough\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), SDLP and Alliance Party met the secretary of state in London on Wednesday.\n\nAfterwards, the DUP said that the onus was on the government to introduce new legislation at Westminster from September.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak negotiated the Windsor Framework with the EU to address some of the problems created by the post-Brexit Irish Sea border.\n\nBut the DUP said it still had many concerns and submitted an 18-page document to the government outlining its demands before it will return to Stormont.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in delegation told reporters that the party has not seen that document because, so far, it had only been shared with the government.\n\nThe talks are aimed at restoring Stormont's devolved institutions at Stormont which collapsed in February 2022\n\nSpeaking after meeting Mr Heaton-Harris on Wednesday, the DUP's deputy leader, Gavin Robinson, said the government knows what steps are needed to restore devolution.\n\n\"They are going to have to bring forward measures in the House of Commons that address the constitutional issues that we have highlighted,\" he added.\n\nHowever, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the DUP had been given \"far too much road\" and that it was time for the government to get much tougher on them.\n\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, the Foyle MP said the DUP \"need to get back to work\" as local people are frustrated.\n\n\"We have a quarter of the population on hospital waiting lists and we have the DUP playing games,\" Mr Eastwood said.\n\nColum Eastwood says he is downbeat about Stormont being restored soon\n\n\"We are in this sort of de facto direct rule situation where the British government is making decisions when we need local people making those decisions.\"\n\nAlliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry said he was \"not entirely sure that the government and the DUP are on the same page\" in terms of requests for new legislation to deal with the DUP's concerns over the Windsor Framework.\n\nStephen Farry from Alliance said he was concerned about Stormont's worsening finances during the wait to restore devolution\n\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster that he too did not know exactly what the DUP has asked for.\n\n\"I hear the rhetoric at times from the DUP. I hear demands at times that are unrealistic,\" Mr Farry said.\n\nThe North Down MP added: \"I am concerned - and the longer this drifts, the worse the current financial crisis gets in Northern Ireland.\"This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe chief constable of Police Scotland has admitted that the force is institutionally racist and discriminatory.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone said prejudice and bad behaviour within the force was \"rightly of great concern\".\n\nHe also said that acknowledging the issues exist was vital for real change to happen.\n\nA review recently uncovered first-hand accounts of racism, sexism and homophobia by serving officers.\n\nIt also heard about cases where staff had been \"punished\" for raising concerns.\n\nSir Iain's statement is believed to be the first of its kind by a police chief and comes amid ongoing controversy about policing culture in the UK.\n\nBut he stressed that his admission of institutional discrimination did not mean that individual officers and staff were racist or sexist and expressed pride and confidence in their work.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority on Thursday morning, Sir Iain said: \"It is the right thing for me to do, as Chief Constable, to clearly state that institutional racism, sexism, misogyny and discrimination exist.\n\n\"Police Scotland is institutionally racist and discriminatory. Publicly acknowledging these institutional issues exist in our organisation is essential to our absolute commitment to championing equality and becoming an anti-racist service,\n\n\"It is also critical to our determination to lead wider change and support wider change in society.\"\n\nSir Iain, who is to retire on 10 August, admitted that people from different backgrounds or with different requirements \"don't always get the service that is their right\" and that this was also true for the force's own officers and staff.\n\nSir William Macpherson's definition of institutional racism, set out in his 1999 report into the killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, is the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin.\n\nIt can include processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone is to retire as chief constable in the summer\n\nSir Iain said the force had already put in place measures including enhanced vetting of its officers and a more rigorous recruitment process to help tackle the issue.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf said that, as a person of colour, the admission of institutional racism by the chief constable was \"monumental\" and \"historic\".\n", "that under the Data Protection Act 2018, the right of access to personal data does not apply to data processed for the honours system.\n\nIn a multi-tweet thread Ms Dorries said she had requested copies of WhatsApp messages, texts, emails and meeting minutes. relating to the process of her nomination for the House of Lords\n\nOnce she receives them she will \"take the time to properly consider the information I am provided\", Ms Dorries added.\n\nShe went on to say it is \"absolutely my intention to resign\" but \"this process is now sadly necessary\".\n\nShe added that her \"office continues to function as normal and will of course continue to serve my constituents\".\n\nBefore Ms Dorries' announcement, No 10 said it was important for her constituents to have \"certainty\".\n\n\"It is obviously unusual to have an MP say they will resign with immediate effect and for that not to take place,\" the prime minister's press secretary added.\n\nMr Johnson also announced he was leaving Parliament on Friday, ahead of a Commons report expected to accuse him of misleading MPs over the Partygate scandal, which is due to be published on Thursday.\n\nNigel Adams, one of Mr Johnson's other close allies, stood down as an MP on Monday, following reports his name was also removed from the list of approved peerages.\n\nThe by-elections to replace them were triggered on Wednesday, with 3 July or 20 July the possible polling dates.\n\nWhile Ms Dorries remains a member of Parliament, she can turn up in the House of Commons chamber to make her views known.\n\nAnything she says would be covered by parliamentary privilege, allowing her to be outspoken on any issue, without fear of legal consequences.\n\nThe Conservatives - who are trailing Labour in national polls - wanted to conclude swift campaigns before Parliament's summer recess and for any political pain from the by-elections to be short and sharp.\n\nBut if Ms Dorries keeps her party waiting, she could force them into a potentially divisive by-election later on - for example, ahead of the autumn party conference season.A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza. These are among the new finds being turned up at the Pompeii Archaeological Park.\n\nDig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure - a snapshot of a lost Roman world.\n\nIt's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated.\n\n\"Much of that will be for future generations,\" says Alessandro Russo, the co-lead archaeologist on the new dig.\n\n\"We have a problem to conserve what we've already found. Future generations may have new ideas, new techniques.\"\n\nThe latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century.\n\nBack then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind.\n\nThey had identified a laundry but that was about it.\n\nExcavation work under way in the searing summer heat, in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius\n\nNow, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.\n\nThe dig site is, in effect, a whole city block. It is known as an insula and is some 3,000 sq m (32,000 sq ft) in size.\n\nBBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC.\n\nThe giant oven could have baked 100 loaves of bread daily\n\n\"Every room in every house has its own micro-story in the grander story of Pompeii. I want to uncover those micro-stories,\" says Gennaro Iovino.\n\nThe other co-lead archaeologist wants you to imagine that you are entering a delightful atrium - an entrance hall - with a hole in the roof where lion figureheads direct rainwater down onto a fountain, next to a statue.\n\nThe builders were clearly doing some repairs at the time of the eruption because the roof tiles are neatly stacked in two piles. But this is not a magnificent villa, like some of the imposing homes found elsewhere in Pompeii.\n\nThis building would have been part-commercial because, on turning right, you are confronted by a giant oven, big enough to be producing 100 loaves a day.\n\nRoughly 50 bakeries have already been found in Pompeii. This, however, can't have been a shop because there is no shop front.\n\nIt's more likely to have been a wholesaler, distributing bread across town, perhaps to the many fast-food joints for which Pompeii was so famous.\n\nThe discovery of a fresco depicting a piece of round flatbread on a silver tray, accompanied by pomegranate, dates, nuts and arbutus fruits, caused a sensation when it was announced to the world in June.\n\nIt's not a pizza, though. Tomatoes and mozzarella, two ingredients in the classic Neapolitan recipe, were not available in Italy in the first century AD.\n\nPerhaps it's a piece of focaccia? The pizza thing started as a bit of a joke, says Gennaro. \"I emailed a picture to my boss, saying 'first the oven, now the pizza'.\"\n\nWith Naples - the home of pizza - a short distance away, the discovery naturally caused a sensation\n\nThe world just went crazy after that. A cover will soon be built over the fresco to try to protect it from the elements.\n\nThe 20,000 visitors who come to Pompeii every day will demand to see the \"ancestor to the pizza\", as some are now describing the fresco subject.\n\nFor the moment, the skeletons are being kept in a specially constructed store room\n\nIt's easy to forget that Pompeii was a human tragedy. We have little idea how many died. You have to believe most residents left when they saw the horror unfolding at the top of Vesuvius.\n\nSkeletons have been recovered, perhaps 1,300 to 1,500 in total, and the new dig has its own examples: two women and a child of unknown sex.\n\nA ball joint at the top of a human thigh bone (femur)\n\nLooking at where the victims were found, it's obvious that they were trying to take cover, hoping that by hiding under a staircase, they would be safe.\n\nWhat they hadn't counted on was the roof collapsing from the weight of all the lapilli and ash. The heavy stonework smashed their bodies.\n\nThe drama of those momentous days in October AD79 are also revealed on the other side of the atrium in what was once a bedroom.\n\nThe bed itself is a charred mass - caused by a fire. It is barely recognisable apart from its broad outline seared into the walls and floor.\n\nThe bedroom might have caught fire when a lamp was knocked over in the panic to escape the eruption\n\nIf you look closely at the debris, you can see blackened fragments of the textile bedclothes and even the filling from the mattress.\n\nA fragment of what is left of the mattress\n\nArchaeologists can tell from the position of these carbonised remains that the fire occurred relatively early in the eruption. They speculate that a lamp might have been knocked over in the panic to get out.\n\n\"It would be interesting to understand who were the people that didn't make it,\" wonders park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel.\n\nWall paintings that look like modern-day wallpaper - \"We're always looking for a surprise,\" says Gabriel Zuchtriegel\n\n\"Were they the poor? More women than men? Or maybe people who had property and tried to stay to protect what they had, while others who had nothing just took off and ran.\"\n\nTowards the back of the area so far excavated there is a wall that encloses three rooms.

It contains some valuable information in relation to marriages and deaths, some of which is new to me,\" said Mr Galway.\n\nThe birth of his father William John Galway, known as Jack, is recorded in the bible in 1926.\n\n\"We knew there was bible from the other side of the family. It was a revelation that this book existed but I recognise some of the later entries as my father's writing so he appears to have kept it up.\"\n\nThe birth of David Galway's father William John Galway, known as Jack, is recorded in the bible in 1926\n\nThe current rector at St Mark's, the Reverend Canon Malcolm Kingston, explained that the gifting of a Bible to newlyweds is still common practice in the Church of Ireland.\n\n\"We would still give a Bible to every couple getting married in the church, although they would not have the family tree and record which seems to be something from the past,\" he said.\n\nMr Galway is unsure how the book got misplaced but believes it may have been donated to a charity shop along with other books after his parents died.\n\nMr Galway said that he recognises his father's writing in some of the later entries in the records\n\nHappy to be reunited with the family record, Mr Galway said that he plans to hand down the Bible to his youngest daughter.\n\n\"We pass down other items and they have been divided among the family, but I think it is important. She's so happy to be keeping it and it will be precious to her.\"\u200bOcean swimming is a popular pastime for many Australians\n\nAn Australian woman has spoken out after she received a warning letter that she had broken surf club rules by being naked in a changing room.\n\nOcean swimmer Nada Pantle was told she had breached a \"no nudity\" clause in the club's child-safe policy.\n\n\"I almost feel like I've been body-shamed,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\nBut the club says its policy is designed to protect children, and they had received complaints about nudity.\n\nThe Terrigal Surf Lifesaving Club, located about an hour's drive north of Sydney, put up signs in its changing rooms advising \"no nudity\", and directing members to shower in their swimming costumes and change under towels.\n\nMs Pantle's friend and fellow ocean swimmer Wendy Farley said they first became aware of the new rule earlier this year.\n\n\"Probably three months ago, a sign went up\u2026 and we all just went 'what?' and kind of ignored it because it seemed crazy,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"We're not strutting around naked, we're just having a shower and putting on our clothes or having a chat.\n\n\"I've been swimming for seven years and I'm 59, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I've ever felt. [When] you're in the change room, you see all sorts of bodies, all ages\u2026 no one cares. This feels really prudish and horrible.\"\n\nMs Farley said Ms Pantle raised the issue at a club meeting, but shortly afterwards she received a letter stating she had breached the no nudity rule, and would be disciplined and asked to leave if she did it again.\n\nMs Pantle instead chose to resign and walk away, Ms Farley said.\n\n\"Nada and I care a lot about child protection but we don't believe this is a constructive solution. I would happily pay higher yearly fees if this is a funding issue,\" she added.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC, Ms Pantle said: \"They didn't say what I did or who had made a complaint, but it sort of implied I'd done something almost sexual.\n\n\"At some point, you've got to take your clothes off to get your other clothes on. That's why we have change rooms.\"\n\nSurf Life Saving New South Wales CEO Steve Pearce said the signage \"probably could have been done better\", but was only done as an interim measure until the changing rooms are renovated.\n\n\"We're aware the facilities are inadequate,\" he told the BBC. \"But [the club] received complaints from some junior members about being intimidated and uncomfortable.\n\nMr Pearce said over a third of the Terrigal club's registered members were aged under 14.\n\n\"Instead of just putting a blanket 'no nudity', if the signs explained why people should refrain from being nude while children were in the change room, it would have been better received, and we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n\"We will be suggesting a better form of signage, but the whole thing was done with the best intent to ensure the psychological well being of the members. It was never intended to be fracturing or divisive.\"Ms Cherry said she was planning to talk about her career in politics as well as her feminist views at the event\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry has told BBC Scotland she has been cancelled by an Edinburgh venue for \"being a lesbian with gender-critical views\".\n\nShe was due to appear at The Stand during the Fringe Festival in August.\n\nThe venue has cancelled the event after staff said they were not comfortable with her views on transgender issues.\n\nThe Edinburgh South MP is a critic of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform plans, which make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex.\n\nMs Cherry told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"I would hope The Stand would see sense here. Staff shouldn't be framing editorial and artistic policy.\n\n\"I'm being cancelled and no-platformed because I'm a lesbian, who holds gender-critical views that somebody's sex is immutable.\n\n\"I've made those views clear over a number of years. I have never said that trans people should not have equal rights.\"\n\nThe show was part of an In Conversation With series of events with interview guests including film director Ken Loach, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\nMs Cherry said she was planning to talk about her career in politics and the independence movement, as well as her feminist views.\n\nShe added: \"Because a small number of people don't like my feminist and lesbian activism, I'm being prevented from talking about all of those things in my home city where I'm an elected politician.\n\n\"I think it says something's gone very wrong in Scotland's civic space.\n\n\"Small groups of activists are now dictating who can speak and what can be discussed.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Tuesday, Ms Cherry said that \"many of my SNP colleagues agree", "1% of the company's total shares.

He passed away on 21 April after his cancer returned.\n\nAli's father told the board of his son's passing during the AGM, and how despite their efforts, there was still black smoke and gas flaring outside his front door.\n\nMr Looney gave his condolences at the meeting to Ali's family and said: \"We are continuing to reduce flaring at Rumaila. We are making progress and it must continue to be made\".\n\nGas flaring at oil fields near Basra, Iraq where BP is a major contractor\n\nThe pension funds told the BBC they only found out about the change in BP's climate targets via media reports.\n\nThey then approached BP to ask for a vote on the new targets but BP refused, arguing it was not a material change to the strategy.\n\nPatrick O'Hara, director of responsible investment at LGPS Central, told the BBC: \"If you change the strategy you should really enter into a dialogue with those that supported you.\"\n\nHe said he thought BP's decision was driven by short-term profit considerations rather than the long term sustainability of the company.\n\n\"Are these strategies science-based if you can flex them based on what the oil and gas price is? We are long-term investors and we expect the company to take a long-term view\", he said.\n\nThe company's profits more than doubled to $27.7bn (\u00a323bn) in 2022, as energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nAs well as protest voting, there were half a dozen green activists removed from BP's annual meeting of its board and shareholders on Thursday, as they demanded the company \"stop drilling\" for fossil fuels.\n\nThe Dutch environmental organisation Follow This also put forward a resolution - supported by the five pension funds - which calls for more aggressive targets on what are known as scope 3 emissions - emissions from the use of its products.\n\nBP recommended that shareholders not support this resolution calling it \"unclear\", \"simplistic\" and \"disruptive\".\n\nISS and Glass Lewis are the world's largest investor services and recommended to BP shareholders they advise to oppose the climate resolution.\n\nCourteney Keatinge, senior director for ESG research at Glass Lewis, said the company does not see BP's actions to reduce its climate targets as a financial risk because the world will continue to use oil and gas past 2050.\n\n\"We are not operating under a net zero 2050 scenario, the demand is going to be there [in 2050], people will be flying planes and heating their homes\", she said.\n\nThe resolution only garnered 16.75% of the vote but that was up on 14.9% the same resolution received last year.\n\nThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.Last updated on .From the section Cricket\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club has suspended three members over altercations with Australia players at Lord's on day five of the second Test.\n\nTelevision footage appeared to show clashes between Usman Khawaja and David Warner and spectators in the Long Room as Australia walked off for lunch.\n\nThe incident came after England's Jonny Bairstow was controversially stumped by Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey.\n\nThe MCC said it had apologised \"unreservedly\" before confirming it had suspended three members identified from the incident.\n\n\"They will not be permitted back to Lord's whilst the investigation takes place,\" the MCC added in a statement.\n\n\"We maintain that the behaviour of a small number of members was completely unacceptable and whilst there was no suggestion by [Australia captain] Pat Cummins in the post-match press conference that there was any physical altercation, it remains wholly unacceptable to behave in such a way, which goes against the values of the club.\n\n\"MCC condemns the behaviour witnessed and once again we re-iterate our apology to Cricket Australia.\"\n\nKhawaja said the behaviour of the members was \"really disappointing\", while Cummins added he thought some could lose their memberships as a result.\n\n\"Lord's is one of my favourite places to come,\" said Khawaja. \"There's always respect shown at Lord's, particularly in the members' pavilion in the Long Room, but there wasn't today.\n\n\"Some of the stuff that was coming out of the members' mouths is really disappointing and I wasn't just going to stand by and cop it.

The bare numbers of his story versus Rangers reveal how much of a bogey man he's been to the Ibrox club.\n\nIn the December meeting at Celtic Park, Kyogo had two shots on target and scored with one of them, which turned out to be the decisive goal.\n\nIn September at Ibrox, he had just nine touches of the ball in 76 minutes, one of them being the match-winner.\n\nLast April, in a 3-2 win, he had two shots on target and two goals from only 17 touches.\n\nA few months earlier, just when it looked like Rangers were going to win 2-1 at Ibrox, Kyogo poked in the equaliser with two minutes left. It was his only attempt on target. He had 15 touches and was largely anonymous, until he wasn't.\n\nThis time last year he was on 26 goals. Now he's on 16.\n\u2022 None Rodgers has no issue with 'top referee' Beaton\n\u2022 None What do the numbers tell us about derby?\n\nHe's had those Old Firm highs, but it's not been a vintage season for Kyogo. He's missed the service of Jota on one side and Liel Abada on the other, the holy trinity of the Ange Postecoglou years.\n\nHe's playing deeper under Rodgers and has suffered from the musical chairs on either side of him, the constant changing of the wide players and the lack of fluency it has brought at times. Some of that has been down to injury.\n\nHe'll still occupy the every waking thought of the Rangers defence in the build-up to Sunday.\n\nThey all know about his stealth, they've all been burned by his capacity to appear under the thumb for large parts of a game before, metaphorically, breaking free and thumping them in the face. In Kyogo, Celtic will continue to trust.\n\nIf Kyogo has inflicted pain on Rangers, then Brendan Rodgers has really been torturer-in-chief.\n\nFifteen games with 12 victories and only one defeat. A 4-0, a 5-0 and a 5-1. A total of 34 goals scored and only eight conceded. 1,350 minutes played and behind for only 108 of those. Eight clean sheets to Rangers' two.\n\nEven when his team have looked shaky, they've still done the job.\n\nGoing into the first meeting of the season, Celtic had drawn with St Johnstone and had lost to Kilmarnock in their previous two games. Rangers smelt blood at Ibrox that day. Celtic won 1-0.\n\nEarlier in December, they lost to Kilmarnock and Hearts before facing Rangers. Philippe Clement's side had gone unbeaten in 16 matches, winning 13, one of which was away to Real Betis in the Europa League. A Betis team who five days before had drawn 1-1 with the Real Madrid of Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Federico Valverde.\n\n'It wasn't supposed to be like this for prodigal son'\n\nRodgers' dominance has entered the history books. With an 80% win rate, he has the highest win return of any Old Firm manager in major competitions.\n\nDoubt from the outside world accompanied all the way to kick-off in both of his games against Rangers this season but Rodgers - and Kyogo - came up with the solutions. But there's doubt again now.\n\nThis season has not been the Celtic procession that some might have thought it was going to be. Rangers have got their act together while Celtic have bobbed along on choppy waters.\n\nA poor summer transfer window followed by a poor January transfer window. The sound of booing at Celtic Park. The sound of Rodgers having a go at those booing. The endless grief with the Green Brigade. The \"good girl\" saga that saw Rodgers slammed by a women's campaigning group. The Scottish FA charge - and subsequent touchline ban - for accusing officials of incompetence.\n\nIt's been a grind. Five draws and three defeats. Ninetieth-minute wins against Hibs and Motherwell twice. It wasn't supposed to be like this for the prodigal son.\n\nAnd yet, they're still top of the league, albeit with Rangers having a game in hand.\n\nThey've scored more goals than their city rivals, have a higher expected goals count and have created more big chances.\n\nThey've not been fluent nearly as often as Rodgers would have liked - he's had some harsh words to say about their negativity and their lack of speed of thought and movement along the way - but they're still there.\n\nAnd if they win, or even draw, on Sunday you'd make them favourites to win the title because they'll have Rangers at Celtic Park post-split, a Celtic Park that will be heaving to the sound of 60,000 fans getting on the backs of visiting players, many of whom have never closed a deal as big as this one.\n\nRangers will be encouraged by Callum McGregor's absence since the end of February and hopeful that, even if he is ready to play, then he won't be at his totemic best.\n\nFor Rodgers, it's bigger this time. He has never faced this kind of game in Scotland before, a game that if lost could - and most probably would - cost him the title.\n\nThat's alien territory for the Celtic manager. In his previous incarnation they'd have been organising the party by now.\n\nIt's what makes Sunday so intoxicating. Rodgers, and how he will be viewed by Celtic fans in victory or in defeat, is a drama unto itself. Given their complicated feelings about him, it's a love-in or a pile-on balanced on a knife edge.\n\nAll 15 of his Old Firm games have been important, but this one holds more peril than any of the others.\n\nHave your say on Rodgers & Celtic\n\nIf the form doesn't load properly, go straight to it here...\n\u2022 Celtic is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Celtic - go straight to all the best contentThe co-founder and guitarist of Irish rock band The Script, Mark Sheehan, has died.\n\nThe 46-year-old died in hospital on Friday following a brief illness, the band announced.\n\nSheehan formed the group in 2001 alongside vocalist Danny O'Donoghue and drummer Glen Power.\n\nA statement on the band's social media pages said Sheehan was a \"much loved husband, father, brother, band mate and friend\".\n\nIt asked fans to respect the privacy of his family and bandmates.\n\nIreland's president Michael D Higgins said Sheehan was an \"outstanding\" example of Irish musical success on the world stage.\n\n\"It was a mark of the originality and excellence that Mark and his bandmates in The Script sought that they saw such success across the world, including six number one albums in the UK and a number three album in the United States - a truly remarkable achievement,\" he said.\n\nContemporaries of Sheehan's in the entertainment industry were quick to honour his memory.\n\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Irish presenter Laura Whitmore wrote: \"Thinking of you all at this time.\n\n\"Mark was one of the nicest and most talented men you could meet.\"\n\nFellow Irish rock band Kodaline have also paid tribute, posting on Twitter: \"So sorry to hear (of) the passing of Mark Sheehan.\"\n\nIn an Instagram tribute, Irish pop duo Jedward said: \"Everyone in the Irish music industry and worldwide mourn your loss RIP Mark such a talented musician from The Script one of the most iconic Irish groups of our generation.\"\n\nFellow musicians and celebrities have come forward to pay tribute to Mark Sheehan\n\nSheehan was born on 29 October 1976 in Dublin in Mount Brown in The Liberties area, and was married to", "but she became less able to move using a wheelchair.\n\nKaylea had not been seen by any medical professional in the nine months prior to her death, the court was told, and the evidence of a doctor was that the \"consequences of neglect\" were the worst he had seen in 30 years of practice.\n\nIn the three months before her death, the household had spent a total of \u00a31,035.76 on takeaway food.\n\n\"As her condition deteriorated, the expenditure on takeaways and fast food increased,\" Ms Rees said.\n\nThe court heard that Kaylea was \"eating, sleeping and defecating\" from her bed.\n\n\"The last months of Kaylea Titford's life must have been horrendous,\" Ms Rees said.\n\nThe court also heard a series of text messages between Kaylea and her mother in August and September 2020, in which she asked for help with \"incontinence needs\".\n\n\"It shows that Sarah Lloyd-Jones was fully aware, and did not do anything about it,\" Ms Rees said.\n\nMs Rees said it was not a \"lapse\" in care, but \"repeated negligent conduct in the face of obvious suffering\".\n\nShe added: \"Both parents had a duty of care, both were equally responsible. The fact that Alun Titford chose to absent himself from the care of Kaylea, does not give him an excuse.\"\n\nKaylea was subjected to \"shocking and prolonged\" neglect at the hands of her parents\n\nIn mitigation for Lloyd-Jones, Lewis Power KC said his client had an \"epiphany of insight into her actions\", leading to her guilty plea.\n\n\"She accepts that she owed her daughter a duty of care, and that she did breach that duty by failing to take reasonable care for her daughter's health and welfare needs.\"\n\nMr Power said that, prior to the pandemic, Lloyd-Jones was \"a lady who tried her best\", and added that she suffered from depression and became \"gradually overwhelmed\", particularly due to the \"pressures of lockdown\".\n\nDavid Elias KC, representing Titford, said his client showed \"genuine remorse\" and that the pair had been \"good parents\" up until the lockdown period.\n\nHe said that Titford suffered from depression and a historic drug addiction, \"lacked confidence\" and was \"overly reliant\" on others.\n\nHowever, the judge said he \"did not accept\" that outside agencies should have been more proactive.\n\n\"They never asked for help they didn't get. They never asked for help at all,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement after the sentencing, Dean Quick of the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"No child should have to endure these types of living conditions or the extensive level of suffering faced by Kaylea.\n\n\"The level of neglect in this case was some of the most extreme that CPS Cymru-Wales has had to deal with.\"\n\nDet Ch Insp Jon Rees, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said the conditions Kaylea lived in were \"incomprehensible\".\n\n\"While we did all we could to ensure we got justice for Kaylea, nothing will take away from the loss of a teenage girl who was so badly let down by the very people who should have been caring for her,\" he added.\n\nNSPCC Cymru said the case was \"incredibly distressing\", adding that the forthcoming safeguarding review \"must leave no stone unturned\" in establishing whether more could have been done to protect Kaylea.\n\nPowys council said a review would be carried out by the mid and west Wales regional safeguarding children board.\n\nA spokesman added: \"The council does not feel able to comment until this process has been completed.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and adviceChildren are at most risk of exceeding the safe limits on aspartame, found in diet drinks\n\nAdvice on how much aspartame we can eat or drink is unchanged, despite the sweetener being classified as \"possibly\" causing cancer.\n\nTwo groups of experts at the World Health Organization have been reviewing thousands of scientific studies.\n\nThe \"possibly carcinogenic\" label often causes fear and confusion, but just means the evidence is unconvincing.\n\nMost people consume less than the safe upper limits of aspartame, but the WHO recommends heavy consumers cut down.\n\nAspartame is found in diet and sugar-free versions of foods, as the chemical gives a taste 200 times sweeter than sugar for little calories.\n\nFamous brands containing the sweetener include Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Pepsi Max and 7 Up Free, but aspartame is in around 6,000 products ranging from toothpaste and chewing gums to yoghurts and cough sweets.\n\nDespite being so widespread, the chemical's safety has been a source of controversy since it was introduced in the 1980s.\n\nI asked Dr Francesco Branca, the director of the department of nutrition and food safety at the World Health Organisation (WHO), what was the healthier choice: sugar or sweetener?\n\nHe told me: \"Faced with a decision of whether to take cola with sweeteners or one with sugar, I think there should be a third option, which is to drink water instead and to limit the consumption of sweetened products altogether.\"\n\nHe said the reviews had \"raised the flag\" that aspartame may not be great for your health, but said you \"shouldn't have a concern\" about an occasional diet drink or other product containing the sweetener, adding \"the problem is for high consumers\".\n\nThe first body to assess the evidence was the WHO's cancer experts - the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\nIARC uses four possible classifications:\n\nIt has moved aspartame into the \"possibly carcinogenic\" category alongside other substances such as aloe vera and lead. This decision largely centres on three studies suggesting a connection to a type of liver cancer.\n\nHowever, the \"possibly\" refers only to the strength of scientific evidence. If the evidence was strong, then aspartame would be in a higher category.\n\nDr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the \"evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\" and \"this is really more a call to the research community\" to study the sweetener more.\n\nThe cancer classifications frequently lead to misleading headlines. Alcohol and plutonium are in the same category (both are proven to cause cancer), but one is seriously more dangerous than the other.\n\nSo a separate body - the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives - has the job of working out safe doses.\n\nIt analysed the cancer risk as well as other issues such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but found \"no sufficient reason\" to alter the advice it has had since 1981.\n\nSo the safe limits remain at 40 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight, per day.\n\nThese aren't targets, they're the upper safety limits. But as the advice is based on body weight, it is easier for children to get close to the limit.\n\nDr Branca said it was \"not a good practice\" to have a bottle of sweet fizzy drink on the table at family dinner time, as children risked being set up with a sweet tooth for life.\n\nHe also stressed that large reviews of the evidence show sweeteners do not help people lose weight.\n\nSo his advice is for everyone to shift to a less sweet diet - cutting both sugar and sweeteners - and for companies to produce foods that are less sweet, but still tasty.\n\nOne of the big outstanding research questions is how might aspartame result in cancer (if indeed it does). The WHO reports show that aspartame itself is rapidly broken down in the gut into three other substances - phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol.\n\nBut these are also the product of digesting a wide variety of other foods that are not linked with cancer. And the researchers concluded that aspartame is not directly making cancerous mutations in people's DNA.

The number of women working as web designers increased by almost 10,000.\n\nBut even with these gains, women currently only make up 25% of coding jobs, according to SheCodes.\n\nJessica, from Glasgow, was a primary school teacher in Renfrewshire who had reached the point of burnout after being in the classroom for five years.\n\nShe says she was spending evenings and weekends preparing lessons, forking out her own money on resources for the children or asking family and friends to borrow things she could use in the class.\n\n\"I could never unwind from it,\" she says.\n\nThe 28-year old says she \"had no idea\" about jobs in tech until she saw an Instagram advert by Code First Girls offering a free eight week course on coding.\n\n\"I didn't have science or maths at school so I didn't think I could manage to code - I thought that those doors in STEM were closed,\" she said. \"To be honest I didn't even really know what a software engineer was.\n\n\"I assumed it was a geeky, guys job - I certainly didn't know any other women in these roles that I could look at as a role model or inspiration.\"\n\nAfter the initial course, Jessica went on to do further studies in coding in the evenings while still teaching, which she says was \"tough but worth it\".\n\nNow she works as a junior software engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming, and says she is much happier in the role despite not earning as much money as she was when teaching.\n\nJessica was part of a group on Facebook called \"Life after teaching\" and after sharing her story there she said her inbox was \"flooded with other teachers saying they are also looking to change careers\".\n\nShe then decided to set up an Instagram page called @teacher2coder to tell other women about what a tech job involves.\n\n\"I previously discounted coding as something for computer scientists or geniuses. But if you are good at communicating and problem solving - a job in tech can be for you.\"\n\nThaslima Ferdous, 25, studied biomedical science at university and had the intention of becoming a doctor one day, so was working as a healthcare assistant in the NHS in London.\n\nThaslima Ferdous left the NHS to become a data engineer\n\n\"The NHS was really struggling and I felt unappreciated,\" she says.\n\nAfter reading a story about a young woman who had become a coder, she began to wonder if she could switch careers but was sceptical about working in tech when she had a pure science background.\n\n\"I began to think 'what do I have to lose?' So decided to do a 14 week coding bootcamp which taught me the foundations of python and SQL.\"\n\n\"My team is entirely male but this is the start,\" she adds.\n\n\"I don't think career changing is as daunting as it used to be. If you're willing to work hard and put in the hours, there's no reason why a tech job isn't for you.\"\n\nONS labour force survey data from June 2022 showed that while there were 512,900 men working as programmers, software development professionals, web design professionals and data analysts, there were only 113,900 women doing these jobs - just 18.17%.\n\nFemale-founded Code First Girls provides free coding courses to women, helping companies recruit by connecting them with newly trained female developers.\n\nAnna Brailsford, chief executive of the social enterprise, says women need to be given the chance to change their minds about the stereotypes surrounding careers in STEM.\n\n\"There is a whole pool of untapped talent amongst those who started out in different fields of study and in different careers,\" she says.\n\n\"These are candidates who may have never considered a STEM career before, convinced it was a career just for men, or that they didn't have the right skills. But they come with a wealth of experience to change things in technology for the better.\"The world will likely use fewer fossil fuels to produce electricity this year in a \"turning point\" for planet-friendly energy, a new report says.\n\nIt would be the first ever annual drop in the use of coal, oil and gas to generate electricity, outside of a global recession or pandemic.\n\nAs a result, fewer warming gases would be released during energy production.\n\nThe authors attribute the expected change to a boom in renewable energy led mainly by China.\n\nWind and solar now produce 12% of global electricity with enough wind turbines added in 2022 to power almost all of the UK.\n\nRenewables are set to meet all growth in demand this year, the study from energy analysts Ember says.\n\nMaking electricity is the single biggest contributor to global warming, responsible for over a third of energy-related carbon emissions in 2021.\n\nSo phasing out coal, oil and gas in this sector is seen as critical in helping the world avoid dangerous levels of climate change.\n\nThis new study looks at data from countries representing 93% of global electricity demand.\n\nEnough wind energy was added globally to almost power the UK\n\nThis, the fourth edition of Ember's Global Electricity Review, indicates that significant progress is now being made in reducing the role of fossil fuels in power production.\n\nThe major developments are the continuing rise of solar and wind as economically viable sources of electricity. Around the world, solar grew by 24% last year, enough to meet the annual demands of a country as big as South Africa.\n\nTaken together with nuclear and hydropower, clean sources produced 39% of global electricity in 2022. The report finds that electricity produced last year was, in effect, the cleanest ever made.\n\nBut despite this, carbon emissions from the sector also continued to rise, as coal use edged up.\n\nChina added around 40% of the world's new solar panels last year, with large numbers of rooftop installations\n\nAccording to the report's authors this is because overall demand for electricity rose, and not all of it was met from clean sources.\n\nThere were also problems with nuclear and hydro electricity in 2022, with many French reactors offline, and Europe's rivers too low in many places for hydro generation.\n\nHowever the report says that in 2023, the growth of wind and solar will be greater than the rise in demand - and this will start to turn the tide on warming gases.\n\n\"When you stop adding more fossil fuels to generate your electricity, you start seeing a fall in emissions,\" said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, the report's lead author.\n", "ess course for her.\n\nThe home secretary was caught speeding in 2022 and, according to reports, asked the civil service for advice on arranging a private course.\n\nThe PM is under pressure to investigate whether she broke the ministerial code.\n\nRishi Sunak has asked his ethics adviser about the case.\n\nHe has also spoken to the home secretary, and Downing Street said he still had confidence in the home secretary.\n\nMrs Braverman is under scrutiny not over the speeding offence itself, but over whether she acted properly in relation to the civil service, by asking officials to assist with a private matter, over a one-to-one speed awareness course.\n\nAfter being caught speeding, Ms Braverman faced getting three points on her licence and a fine, or a course as part of a group.\n\nA government source told the BBC the senior minister had been \"concerned\" about her insurance premiums, and favoured doing a course. She is reported to have asked civil servants about a one-on-one course, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group. She was told it was not a matter for the civil service.\n\nShe then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a private course.\n\nWhen the speed course provider said there was no option to do this, Mrs Braverman opted to pay the fine and accept the points, because she was \"very busy\" a source told the BBC. By this point she had been reappointed as home secretary in Mr Sunak's government.\n\nThe same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.\n\nSpeeding awareness course providers are contracted by individual police forces. According to UK Road Offender Education, the not-for-profit organisation responsible, these contracts make \"no provision for private one-to-one courses\" at the request of the driver.\n\nThe ministerial code requires ministers to ensure \"no conflict arises\" between their public duties and their private interests.\n\nRepeatedly asked in an interview whether she instructed officials to arrange a one-on-one speeding course, Mrs Braverman said: \"Last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points.\"\n\nAsked whether she would welcome an investigation into what happened or if she had spoken to the prime minister about it, Ms Braverman said: \"I am focussed on working as the home secretary.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Yvette Cooper claims Suella Braverman is \"not answering basic factual questions\" about her 2022 speeding fine\n\nSpeaking to the Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, former senior civil servant Sir Philip Rycroft said Mrs Braverman's reported actions appeared to be a \"real lapse of judgement\".\n\n\"Obviously, there's still investigations to be done and so on but the code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.\n\n\"Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position.\"\n\nThe ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.\n\nFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4's World at One, he was confident Ms Braverman had not broken any rules.\n\n\"What goes on in private offices is a minister is busy and has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something the civil servants can't do,\" he said.\n\n\"As soon as once they say no, and you accept it, you haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Sunak told MPs he has \"asked for further information\" and will update MPs \"on the appropriate course of action in due course\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak \"wants to avail himself of all the information before he makes a decision\". The prime minister still has confidence in the home secretary, the spokesman added.\n\nMrs Braverman was in Downing Street on Monday lunchtime, and afterwards headed to the House of Commons for a scheduled question session from MPs on Home Office issues.\n\nDuring the session, Mrs Braverman was repeatedly pressed on whether she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"If the home secretary can't grip on her own rule-breaking behaviour how can she get a grip on anything else.\"\n\nThe home secretary told MPs she had paid the speeding fine and had not sought to avoid any sanction.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should order his adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate whether ministerial rules were broken.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said it looked like \"inappropriate action took place\" from the home secretary that \"needs to be fully investigated\".\n\n\"The usual consequence of breaking the ministerial code is that you'll go,\" he added.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are also calling for an investigation and said Mr Sunak needed to make a statement in Parliament about the claims.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nAnswering questions at the G7 summit over the weekend, Mr Sunak apparently did not know anything about the story the until it was first reported in the Sunday Times. and he declined to say whether he would be ordering an investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed Mrs Braverman - but a Downing Street source later said that \"of course\" he did.\n\nAfter serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.\n\nShe resigned on 19 October after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a \"technical infringement of the rules\". But she was reappointed to the same role by Mr Sunak six days later following the collapse of Liz Truss's government.Ukraine has been planning its counter-offensive for months - and it now may finally be under way\n\nWas this the week that Ukraine's long-anticipated counter-offensive finally got under way?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. \"We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun,\" he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday.\n\nIn some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as \"shaping operations\": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines.\n\nMonday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front,\" Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC.\n\n\"That means there's a probing of Russian defences.\"\n\nSome videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble.\n\n\"Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses,\" Mr Kuzan said. \"And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back.\"\n\nMr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nBy Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River.\n\nFor all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance.\n\nIt seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table.\n\nKyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once.\n\nIn late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson.\n\nThe extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known", "Bridges was critical of the state of British Cycling and its treatment of transgender riders.\n\n\"Cycling is still one of the whitest, straightest sports out there and you couldn't care less,\" she said. \"I agree there needs to be a nuanced policy discussion and continue to conduct research. This hasn't happened.\n\n\"Research isn't being viewed critically, or any discussion about the relevance of the data to specific sports.\n\n\"I've given my body up to science for the last two years, and this data will be out soon.\n\n\"There is actual, relevant data coming soon and discussions need to be had.\"\n\nBridges claimed discussion of the debate is \"inherently political\" and \"framed by the media who are driven through engagement by hate\", saying she was \"terrified to exist\".\n\nShe claimed British Cycling was \"furthering a genocide against us. Bans from sport is how it starts\".\n\nShe added: \"I know a lot of people will think I'm being dramatic, or overplaying how scary things are at the moment. I don't even know if I want to race my bike any more\u2026 but you have no right on telling me when I am done.\"\n\nBritish Cycling is not commenting on Bridges' statement.\n\nHaving been a highly promising competitor in junior men's events, Bridges came out as transgender in 2020, starting hormone therapy as part of her gender dysphoria treatment.\n\nShe then became eligible to compete in elite women's events under British Cycling's transgender regulations, which required riders to have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition.\n\nBut days before the 2022 National Omnium Championships, the UCI said Bridges' participation could only be allowed once her eligibility to race in international competitions was confirmed, dashing her hopes of competing for Wales in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nA group of elite female cyclists called on the UCI to \"rescind\" its rules around transgender participation, claiming female athletes in the UK were \"willing to boycott\" events over their \"concerns about fairness in their sport\".\n\nBridges said she felt \"harassed and demonised\" and had \"little clarity\" on her eligibility. She added that she \"does not have any advantage\" over her competitors, and could prove it with data.\n\nWhile British Cycling suspended its rules, the UCI then toughened its regulations, doubling the qualification period to two years and lowering the required testosterone threshold for transgender women riders to 2.5nmol/L.\n\nBut this month, after Austin Killips became the first transgender woman to win a UCI women's stage race at the Tour of the Gila, the world governing body re-opened consultation on the issue, saying it \"hears the voices of female athletes and their concerns about an equal playing field for competitors\".\n\n\"We acknowledge the paucity of research at this time, but can only look at what's available to use,\" said British Cycling chief executive Jon Dutton.\n\n\"I am confident that we have developed policies that both safeguard the fairness of cycle-sport competition, whilst ensuring all riders have opportunities to participate.\n\n\"We have always been very clear that this is a challenge far greater than one sport. We remain committed to listening to our communities, to monitor changes in the scientific and policy landscape, to ensure that sport is inclusive for all.\"\n\nFiona McAnena from Fair Play For Women told BBC Radio 4's World at One she was \"concerned about all the women and girls who need to know that sport will be fair so I think an open category is a great solution because it doesn't negate anyone's identity\u2026[and] the female category can be protected.\"\n\n\"We're finally reverting to fairness. We are going to see it across all sports.\"\n\nHowever Joanna Harper - a sports scientist who studies the effects of transition on transgender athletes, and who is transgender herself - said she was \"disappointed but not surprised\".\n\n\"I don't think it's necessary\" she told BBC Radio 5Live. \"Trans women have been competing in cycling for many years\u2026and although they have achieved some success in the sport, they are under-represented and are not anywhere near taking over the sport.\"\n\nIn March, UK Athletics also banned transgender women from competing in the female category in its competitions and events. There have been similar moves in swimming,triathlon and both codes of rugby.\n\nA number of studies have suggested transgender women retain cardiovascular and strength advantages compared to female athletes, even after taking testosterone-suppressing hormones.\n\nCritics of transgender athletes' participation in some women's sports argue that gives them a disproportionate advantage over their peers and limits opportunities for their rivals.\n\nHowever, others argue there is not enough detailed research in the area, that the science is not clear, and that with very few elite transgender athletes, sport should be more inclusive, with open categories criticised for being discriminatory.\n\nBritish Cycling said its women-only community programme \"will continue to remain open and inclusive for transgender women and non-binary people\" who can \"continue to participate in a broad range of British Cycling activities in line with their gender identities\".\n\u2022 None Will they carve a brighter future down under?\n\u2022 None Michael Mosley chews over the surprising benefits of these nutrient powerhousesCCTV footage played in court showed Couzens, using his position as a police officer, to stop Sarah Everard\n\nWayne Couzens, the ex-police officer who used his position to trick his way to raping and murdering Sarah Everard in March 2021, is returning to court this week to be sentenced for indecent exposure.\n\nCouzens will never leave prison. That means the real questions now are whether these earlier offences should have identified him as a violent threat to women - and what his case tells us about so-called flashers going on to commit far more serious sexual offences.\n\nBefore Couzens killed Ms Everard, detectives have identified six incidents of indecent exposure linked to him - he has pleaded guilty to three, while the others will lie on his file.\n\nThe first of those was in June 2015, when Kent Police received a report of a man in a car in Dover exposing himself. A witness gave officers the car registration plate, which was registered to Couzens, then at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Yet officers took no further action.\n\nThen, in November 2020, four months before the murder, a woman was cycling along a country lane in Deal, Kent, when a totally naked man stepped out of a wooded bank and looked straight at her.\n\nShe cycled away, but spotted a number plate of a parked car. That car belonged to Couzens, by now a Met Police officer. A later analysis of mobile phone data placed his phone in the area at the right time. This is one of the three incidents Couzens has admitted.\n\nThe two other admissions are part of four virtually identical allegations of escalating concern in the weeks before the murder.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCouzens repeatedly visited a drive-thru restaurant and exposed himself to staff while sitting in his car, on one occasion while he was paying for food. The last incident was less than a week before Ms Everard disappeared.\n\nSo are these incidents relevant to Ms Everard's murder? Jennifer Grant is a criminologist who studies sex offenders, having worked with them previously as a probation officer.\n\nThe Portsmouth University academic says \"it's a really complicated question to answer\", but there is evidence that some men graduate from indecent exposure to serious sexual assaults and rape.\n\n\"There's long been a suggestion that indecent exposure is connected to anti-social behaviour more generally rather than a sexual motivation. And not everyone who exposes themselves is doing it to get sexual pleasure.\"\n\nThere is a group of offenders who are potentially violent because the way they expose themselves involves anger, and an apparent desire to frighten and control women they approach, she says.\n\nThe most reliable evidence comes from a 2014 United States study analysing data going back 30 years. It concluded that between 5% and 10% of men who commit \"exhibitionist\" crimes escalate to sexual assaults.\n\nWithout getting into the distressing details of what Couzens did, each of his exposure incidents places him in the category of a man seeking", "dispatched.\n\nAmong the other vehicles donated by the US recently were 59 more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. They were used extensively by US forces in Iraq.\n\nIn December, the US also announced it was sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine - and Germany and the Netherlands have recently followed suit.\n\nThis highly sophisticated system has a range of up to 62 miles (100km), depending on the type of missile used, and requires specialised training for Ukrainian soldiers, likely to be carried out at a US Army base in Germany.\n\nBut the system is expensive to operate - one Patriot missile costs around $3m.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, Ukraine has been using Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air systems against Russian attacks.\n\nBefore the conflict began in February, Ukraine had about 250 S-300s and there have been efforts to replenish these with similar systems stockpiled in other former Soviet countries, with some coming from Slovakia.\n\nThe US has also provided Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) to Ukraine. The first Nasams arrived in Ukraine in November.\n\nIn addition, the UK has provided several air defence systems, including Starstreak, designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.\n\nGermany has also provided air defence systems, including the IRIS-T air defence systems which can hit approaching missiles at an altitude of up to 20km.\n\nAmong the long-range rocket launchers sent to Ukraine by the US are the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars. Several European countries have also sent similar systems.\n\nHimars are believed to have been central to Ukraine's success in pushing Russian forces back in the south, particularly in Kherson in November.\n\nCrucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.\n\nThe munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), which is further than the Smerch system on the Russian side.\n\nHimars systems are also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems.\n\nIn the months following the invasion and Russia's retreat from Kyiv, much of the war centred on the east of the country where supplies of artillery to Ukraine were in heavy demand.\n\nAustralia, Canada and the US were among the countries to send advanced M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's D-30 towed gun.\n\nNato countries say they are planning to ramp up their supply of shells, because Ukraine has been using them much at a faster rate than they are being delivered.\n\nThey are asking their domestic manufacturers to increase production.\n\nThousands of Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have also been supplied to Ukraine.\n\nThe weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion.\n\nDrones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations.\n\nTurkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.\n\nThe US had repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for fighter jets, instead focusing on providing military support in other areas.\n\nBut now, President Joe Biden has announced the US will support providing advanced fighter jets - including US-made F-16s - to Ukraine and also back training Ukrainian pilots to fly them.\n\nThe US endorsement will allow other nations to export their own F-16 jets, as the US legally has to approve the re-export of equipment purchased by allies.\n\nThe UK, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Denmark have welcomed the move and will provide support.\n\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Spencer.

He has since been reinstated.\n\nDespite social media bans, he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

She admitted to the difficulties of survivors having to prove to the Church that they need help, but said it could not be avoided.\n\n\"As a scheme that's set up in order to meet need, there has to be some evidence of the need, and some evidence of how the money is spent,\" she says.\n\nThe survivors the BBC have spoken to have said they are desperate to have their final compensation claims settled, so they no longer have to deal with the Church of England.Boris Johnson has submitted a last-ditch letter to the MPs investigating whether he misled Parliament over lockdown parties, as they prepare to publish their findings.\n\nThe privileges committee said it was \"dealing with\" submissions received from the former PM at 23:57 on Monday.\n\nThe committee is set to publish its conclusions this week, but is unlikely to do so on Wednesday, as expected.\n\nMr Johnson quit as an MP last week after seeing the committee's report.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Johnson said the committee should \"publish their report and let the world judge their nonsense\", adding \"they have no excuse for delay\".\n\n\"I have made my views clear to the committee in writing - and will do so more widely when they finally publish,\" he said.\n\nUnder the published process, Mr Johnson was entitled to respond to the committee up to 14 days after receiving its draft findings, which were sent last week.\n\nThe committee said it would deal with the new developments and \"report promptly\".\n\nLast week, the former prime minister branded the committee a \"kangaroo court\" whose purpose \"has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts\".\n\nMr Johnson accused the committee of mounting a \"witch hunt\" against him, and its chairwoman, Labour's Harriet Harman, of showing \"egregious bias\".\n\nThe committee said it had \"followed the procedures\" at all times and accused Mr Johnson of impugning \"the integrity of the House by his statement\".\n\nFor almost a year, the seven-person committee - a majority of whom are Conservatives - have been considering whether Mr Johnson misled MPs about Covid-19 breaches in Downing Street and what he knew about them.\n\nGiving evidence in March, Mr Johnson admitted misleading Parliament, but denied doing it on purpose.\n\nHe said social distancing had not been \"perfect\" at gatherings in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns, but insisted the guidelines, as he understood them, were followed at all times.\n\nThe Partygate scandal dogged Mr Johnson's premiership, with police fining him for breaking Covid rules in 2020 - making him the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law.\n\nMr Johnson's resignation as an MP, which has triggered a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, came last Friday.\n\nMr Johnson said the draft report he had seen was \"riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice\", adding it was clear the committee was \"determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\".\n\n\"They have still not produced a shred of evidence that I knowingly or recklessly misled the Commons,\" he said, insisting \"I did not lie\".The King and his son and grandson were pictured on Coronation day in Buckingham Palace\n\nThe latest official Coronation photograph released by Buckingham Palace sends a strong message about the monarchy's next generations.\n\nKing Charles III is shown with his son Prince William and grandson Prince George, bringing together the King with those next in the line of succession.\n\nThe picture, taken in the palace Throne Room, is part of a set of official photographs taken by Hugo Burnand.\n\nThe King is seen wearing the Imperial State Crown and coronation robes.\n\nIn these formal portraits, he is pictured carrying the regalia from the Coronation -

It contains 7.4g of sugar per 30g serving. This is higher than the recommended average refined sugar intake per meal for adults.\n\nNestle said KitKat cereal was designed to be enjoyed as an \"occasional, indulgent\" breakfast option.\n\nShareAction, a responsible investment non-governmental organisation, has co-ordinated calls from some 26 investors - who have more than \u00a32.64 trillion in assets.\n\nIt comes ahead of Nestle's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday.\n\nSimon Rawson, deputy chief executive of ShareAction, said: \"Nestle has said it wants to sell healthier food, but it hasn't given assurances that it will also address its less healthy food sales, which is essential to turn the tide against the harmful effects of diet-related ill health.\"\n\nHe added that the Swiss food giant needed to \"rebalance\" its sales to bring balanced diets \"within reach for people around the world\".\n\nA spokesperson for Nestle said it had set a new standard in corporate transparency in March.\n\n\"We are the first company to report on the nutritional value of our entire global portfolio against a single externally recognised, nutrient profiling scheme,\" they added in a statement.\n\nMr Rawson said recent research from the World Obesity Federation showed more than half of the world's population would be overweight or obese by 2035, unless \"serious and immediate\" action was taken.\n\nShareAction has written to the boards of various food firms including Kellogg's, Danone and Kraft Heinz, calling for more transparency and for nutrition targets to be set.\n\nNestle, which also manufactures Buxton mineral water"]

The BBC was given exclusive access to a team of elite snipers, referred to as \"the Ghosts of Bakhmut\", who are conducting night raids nearby.\n\nGhost, the sniping team's commander, takes us to the place he calls the \"edge of existence\" - their base on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\"Ghost is my call sign,\" he tells me. \"When we started bringing terror to Bakhmut, we got the name 'the Ghosts of Bakhmut'.\"\n\nTheir base is already well within the range of Russian artillery. Ghost doesn't flinch at the crump of a shell landing nearby. \"The artillery always makes people worry,\" he says. \"You can hide from artillery, but not from a sniper\".\n\nThe Ghosts, a team of about 20 soldiers, have been operating on the edges of Bakhmut for the past six months. They often hunt for high-value targets.\n\nI ask Ghost how many Russians his team have killed. He says, \"There's a confirmed number - 524. Seventy-six of those are mine.\" The team electronically records every shot through the sights of their rifles.\n\nNot everyone's keeping count, though. Kuzia, the marksman for tonight's mission, says: \"It's nothing to be proud of. We're not killing people, we're destroying the enemy.\"\n\nBefore the war, he worked in a factory. He says he never liked guns, but felt compelled to take up arms when Russia invaded.\n\nKuzia does one final check of his US-made Barrett sniper rifle: \"Each mission is dangerous, when we make a mistake the enemy can hit you,\" he says. \"Of course I'm scared - only a fool wouldn't be.\"\n\nSniping team marksman Kuzia checks his rifle one last time before heading out on their mission\n\nOn tonight's mission he'll be accompanied by Taras, his spotter. Kusch is the driver - who'll bring them as close as possible to the front line. From there the two-man team will have to walk more than a mile to reach their target. Ghost will remain back at the base, along with the rookie, known simply as the Brit.\n\nThe youngest member of the team got the name after receiving his initial training in the UK. He's yet to have his first confirmed kill.\n\nGhost says he's handpicked every member of the team based on their \"humanity and patriotism\" rather than their military experience and skills.\n\nAs dusk approaches the team climbs into their armoured Humvee. I, and cameraman Moose Campbell, will accompany them to the drop-off point.\n\nKusch, the driver, tells us that part of the route is still being targeted by Russian artillery.\n\nAs he starts the engine the team all give themselves the sign of the cross. Kusch starts to play some music from his phone. He says the Ukrainian rap song gets them in the mood. But it'll also mask the sound of the shelling.\n\nAt first it's hard to hear the explosions nearby because of the rattle of the Humvee, which Kusch drives at speed over pot-holed tracks. But he points to the sky several times and warns, \"incoming\". There are a few thuds nearby.\n\nWe pass half a dozen wrecked Ukrainian armoured vehicles that weren't so fortunate. Kusch points to minefields on either side of the dirt track.\n\nThe vehicle the team is travelling in is damaged by shrapnel after an explosion nearby",

His replacement, Oh, capped the victory by steering the second from fellow sub Aaron Mooy's delivery to make it four domestic trophies out of five so far for Postecoglou.\n\nCeltic's rejigged defence looked ill at ease for much of the first half as Hearts swarmed at them and forced mistakes.\n\nThe red card was the undoubted turning point and while never hitting their own high standards, Celtic wore down a Hearts side who were galvanised by a sense of injustice.\n\nIn reality, the hard work had already been done. Celtic have been imperious this season, with their sole domestic defeat coming against St Mirren in September. In fact, having lost three of his opening six Premiership games as Celtic manager, Postecoglou has lost just one in the league since.\n\nHis side are now just one goal shy of matching the league haul of 106 achieved by Brendan Rodgers' Invincibles in 2016-17. With four games remaining, that landmark will surely tumble. Winning all those matches would also set a new points record, eclipsing the Invincibles' mark of 106 by one.\n\nAs for Hearts, this defeat will sting, primarily because Naismith's side more than matched the visitors before Cochrane's dismissal.\n\nStill, Aberdeen's defeat at Rangers means the Tynecastle men have not lost ground in the fight for third place. Hearts' performance will enhance their belief the five-point gap is not insurmountable, especially with Aberdeen coming to Tynecastle in a fortnight.\n\nWhat they said\n\nCeltic manager Ange Postecoglou: \"I'm just really proud of this group of players and staff. They've maintained an absolutely ridiculous standard this year. They are relentless in their approach.\n\n\"Having success last year, you always worry as a manager - are they going to be as hungry?

Sir Keir Starmer outlines plans for a 'British jobs bonus' to create new jobs in the UK\n\nLabour will end new North Sea oil and gas exploration, but help communities profit from clean power projects, Sir Keir Starmer has pledged.\n\nSpeaking in Edinburgh, the Labour leader vowed to \"cut bills, create jobs and provide energy security\".\n\nHe also said that a previously announced publicly-owned green energy company would be based in Scotland.\n\nSir Keir is under pressure from environmentalists and the oil industry over the scale and pace of change.\n\nClimate campaigners have criticised the party for rowing back on a pledge to invest £28bn a year in green industries.\n\nIn England, planning rules which effectively ban new onshore wind farm developments would be scrapped if Labour won the next election.\n\nLabour has confirmed it would \"not grant licences to explore new fields\" in the North Sea, a momentous shift for a sector which supports 200,000 UK jobs, including 90,000 in Scotland, according to trade body Offshore Energies UK.\n\nBut the party insisted it would honour any licences in existence at the time of the next election, which must be held by January 2025. That is likely to include the controversial new Rosebank development west of Shetland.\n\nSir Keir said: \"Labour will deliver lower bills, good jobs, and energy security for Scotland and the whole UK, as Britain leads the world in the fight against climate change.\"\n\nHe said it would be a \"historic mistake\" to wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out and let the opportunities \"pass us by\".\n\nThe Labour leader said his party had \"a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges.\"\n\nOne of Labour's initiatives will be to provide more incentives for areas to take part in new clean energy projects. Under Labour's plans, GB Energy - the new publicly-owned firm which it says will be based in Scotland at a location yet to be decided - would play a key role in getting that message across.\n\nIt would oversee the return of profits from successful projects to local councils. The councils could then use that income to reduce council tax, pay for improved public services or simply provide rebates on energy bills.\n\nLabour says GB Energy could end up providing up to £600m per year to local councils to invest in green infrastructure and a further £400m annually in low interest loans for community projects.\n\nThese community loans would be designed to ensure small projects could benefit from the expertise of GB Energy while also generating money for local areas.\n\nSir Keir accused the Conservatives and the SNP of having abysmal records on renewables.\n\nHe said Labour would introduce new rules on \"good work, decent pay and union recognition\" - and create a new incentive.\n\nThis would be \"a British jobs bonus that will attract new investment, new jobs, new supply chains into our deprived industrial heartlands and will reward companies that back working people\".\n\nOffshore Energy UK's chief executive David Whitehouse told the BBC that Labour's plans to move away",

The old guarantees, such as intensity and firepower, have been missing far too often. They all returned here - and how - in the most spectacular manner as Manchester United, who have been undergoing a revival this season, were blown away by a team in full cry. Once Jurgen Klopp's side took control of a tightly contested game just before half-time, they were ruthless. They scored seven, and missed chances to get more. Klopp wanted this to be a pivotal week in the race for the top four as his team look to salvage something from a season that has, to this point, been below par. His players responded. Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten at Anfield and United, to put it mildly, outclassed. Liverpool won 5-0 at Old Trafford and 4-0 at Anfield in the Premier League last season while United had a 2-1 win at home early in this campaign to get the Ten Hag era going - and this was another remarkable game to add to that catalogue. Gakpo was on United's wanted list before he moved to Liverpool in January and his two cool finishes showed why Ten Hag was a fan. Nunez demonstrated his growing threat with a double while Salah always rises to the occasion against United and punished them once more. There was even the perfect finale of a goal in front of the Kop for Firmino, who announced on Friday he would end a great Liverpool career at the conclusion of this season. Liverpool manager Klopp resisted a fist pump celebration in front of the Kop - but for him, this day could not have gone any better. In seven days, Manchester United have gone from the high of their first trophy since 2017 with the Carabao Cup win against Newcastle United at Wembley to the pain of abject humiliation at Anfield. Bizarrely, United were right in this game for 43 minutes, with Fernandes and Rashford missing arguably the game's two best chances before Gakpo scored and the sky fell in on Ten Hag's team. United have had a heavy programme of fixtures but the manner in which they capitulated must be an embarrassment for manager, players and fans. There can be no excuses. Argentine defender Martinez, normally so reliable and combative, was taken apart, especially when Salah led him a merry dance to set up Gakpo to settle the game with Liverpool's third five minutes after half-time. To lose against Liverpool is a painful business at any time but to be on the receiving end of what was a record defeat in this fixture will send shock waves through Old Trafford. They must have thought it could not get worse than the 5-0 home thrashing last season - but this was and was inflicted in front of an ecstatic Anfield. Manchester United must now lick their wounds and return to Europa League action at home to Real Betis on Thursday - and those wounds will hurt after this beating at the home of their arch-rivals.\n• None Delay over.

Officials say they might place the offending piano in a different public location, away from the station loudspeakers.The law will give children the right to funding for services such as counselling\n\nChildren conceived through rape will be officially classified as victims of crime under new government plans.\n\nThe changes, due to be made in the forthcoming Victims Bill, will entitle those conceived as a result of rape access to information about their case.\n\nThe legal changes will also make it easier for victims to receive support from police and the criminal justice system \"whenever they may need it\".\n\nThe law will cover all sexual offences which can result in pregnancy.\n\nEngland and Wales are understood to be among the first nations in the world to officially confer victim status to children born of rape.\n\nAnnouncing the plans, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"No child born in these horrific circumstances should be left to suffer alone, which is why we must ensure they can access vital support whenever they may need it.\n\n\"Our Victims Bill will amplify their voices and boost support for all victims at every stage of the justice system.\"\n\nThe Commons Justice Committee recommended the amendments to the draft Bill, following calls from campaign groups to change the law.\n\nThe statutory 'Victims' Code' sets out the rights available to all victims who report a criminal offence to the police.\n\nThe cross-party Justice Select Committee found individuals who believe they were born as a result of rape currently find it \"unnecessarily difficult\" to get help, including information about their case, because they are not defined by the Code as victims - and guidance is unclear.\n\nThe change in law will entitle them to make a complaint to the police, in their own right - and to receive information and access support in the same way as any other victim of crime.\n\nUnder the ministry's plans, that help could be accessed at any point in their lives, to address issues including alcohol or drug dependency, education and housing benefit.\n\nResearch by academics for the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), who lobbied for the change, estimate that more than 3,000 children may have been conceived after rape in England and Wales in 2021 alone.\n\nThe change, dubbed 'Daisy's Law' by the CWJ, stems from the case of a campaigner who was born as a result of a rape in the 1970s.\n\nDaisy, who is due to speak to Newsnight about her ordeal on Monday, began a long campaign for justice after discovering details of her conception from birth records when she turned 18.\n\nDaisy, who was adopted as a baby, discovered that her birth father, Carvel Bennett, then 28, had raped her birth mother at the age of 13. Police investigated the case but it did not go to court.\n\nRecognising that her birth proved the rape, Daisy pursued a criminal case with the hope of convicting her birth father.\n\nIn legal terms, it was her mother - not her - who was a victim of rape, and it took over a decade before the case went to court.\n\nPolice then opened an investigation after the BBC highlighted Daisy's story in 2019.\n\nAt the age of 74, her birth father was convicted in Birmingham of rape in August 2021.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, she described the decision to extend the definition of a victim as \"momentous\".\n\nShe said: \"I'm still waiting for it to sink in. I hope this changes things for others impacted by being born of rape and at the very least will make them feel they are not alone.\"\n\nThe CWJ said there was evidence that both mothers and children who are rape victims will \"often suffer from attachment difficulties and poor mental health, which in turn can profoundly negatively affect a child's development and educational outcomes, as well as his/her wellbeing in adulthood\".At least six people have died and others remain unaccounted for following a fire in a hostel, New Zealand's prime minister has told local media.\n\nEmergency services were called to the four-storey Loafers Lodge hostel in Wellington just after midnight local time (12:30 GMT Monday).\n\nMore than 50 people were rescued from the building, but police said 11 people remained unaccounted for.\n\nPM Chris Hipkins warned the number of dead was likely to increase.\n\nPolice added that they could not be more specific on the number of deaths until they could access the building.\n\nThe cause of the blaze is still unknown. Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) said they were treating the fire as suspicious, but police \"don't believe it's been deliberately lit\", the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nArriving at the scene, firefighters found the top level of the building ablaze. By 04:00 at least 20 fire engines had been sent to the blaze.\n\nLocal media reports said the sprinklers did not work and officials could not confirm whether fire alarms were working.\n\nFENZ district commander Nick Pyatt described it as Wellington's \"worst nightmare\".\n\nMr Pyatt also said the building contained asbestos and urged locals to wear a face mask and keep their windows closed to avoid inhaling smoke, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\n\"This is a tragic event for all involved. My heartfelt condolences go to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives\", he said.\n\nAuthorities rescued at least five people from the roof of the burning building, while one person sustained serious injuries after jumping from the third floor of the building to escape the flames, local media reported.\n\nOne resident, Tala Sili, told national broadcaster Radio New Zealand he saw smoke coming from under his door and opened it to find the hallway full of smoke. He decided to jump out of the window onto a roof two floors below.\n\n\"It was just scary, it was really scary, but I knew I had to jump out the window or just burn inside the building,\" he said.\n\nLoafers Lodge Hostel has 92 rooms in total and caters to both short and long-term guests.\n\nIt was designated by New Zealand's Ministry of Social Development in 2011 as an emergency accommodation provider. Official figures show that more than 3,300 households currently live in emergency housing as of February.\n\nLoafers customers range from shift workers like nurses and hospital staff to unemployed and homeless people, according to local media reports.\n\nSeveral residents are people who have been deported from Australia, with some still unaccounted for.\n\nIn comments to local media, Mr Hipkins called the fire \"an absolute tragedy\" and paid tribute to local firefighters \"who have put themselves in harm's way over past hours to get people out of the building and put the fire out\".Senior civil servant Sue Gray, who became a household name as the Partygate investigator, has been offered a job as Labour leader Keir Starmer's chief of staff.\n\nMs Gray's inquiry into lockdown gatherings in Downing Street contributed to Boris Johnson's downfall last year and prompted numerous Conservative MPs to call on him to resign.\n\nTory MPs have expressed anger at the job offer, with allies of the former prime minister saying it undermines her report and the impartiality of the civil service.\n\nA Labour spokesman said party leader Sir Keir was \"delighted\" that \"she hopes to accept the role subject to normal procedures\".\n\nThe government confirmed on Thursday that Ms Gray",

There I was feeling relieved that I was going to be charged with a crime. And it was good! I mean, it's just stupid. It just shows how mad things were for me at the time.\"\n\nJohnson's lawyer Tony Woodcock, now retired but then a senior partner at prominent white-collar crime specialists Stephenson Harwood, sees his former client's prosecution as an outrage.\n\nSenior MPs including former Brexit secretary David Davis and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have come to share that view after reading a book I have written exposing the scandal.\n\n\"In over 30 years in practice I never had a case in which I felt so powerless and bullied and where the smell of politics was so rancid. Hopefully all the evil lurking in the mud will be found out,\" Mr Woodcock says.\n\nAndy Verity seeks to interview Peter Johnson outside court in 2016. His lawyer Tony Woodcock is on the right\n\nOne reason he feels so strongly is that Johnson, who worked as a cash trader for Barclays from 1981 to 2011, was the original whistleblower of the interest rate rigging scandal, in which banks paid nearly $9bn in fines and 37 traders and brokers were prosecuted for \"manipulating\" Libor and Euribor, two benchmarks that track the cost of borrowing cash.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Johnson repeatedly alerted the US central bank and the Bank of England to other banks publishing false, low estimates of the interest rates they'd have to pay to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars at a time - so-called \"lowballing\".\n\nHe tried to publish higher, more honest estimates, but kept getting instructions from above to be no more honest than any other bank. Leaked audio recordings indicate the pressure on Johnson to lie came first from the board of Barclays, then from the Bank of England, then from the UK government.\n\nEvidence revealed in the book indicates that then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown's head of policy, the late Sir Jeremy Heywood, was one senior Whitehall figure who wanted Barclays to lower its Libor estimates of the cost of borrowing dollars.\n\n\"I thought they were wrong,\" says Johnson. \"But I didn't feel I had any choice but to go along with them. You're being asked by the UK government and the supreme financial establishment in the land to do something. It's very, very difficult to say, 'No, stuff you!'\"\n\nYet four years later, on 27 June 2012, suppressed anger towards the banks at the lack of accountability for the 2008 banking crisis exploded into the media when Barclays was fined a record £290m by US and UK regulators for rigging interest rates.\n\nBoth Labour and Conservative MPs angrily condemned 14 unnamed traders - which Johnson knew included himself.\n\n\"When something like that happens to a major corporation, there's usually a scapegoat. And I sort of felt that maybe it might be me.\n\n\"Quite justifiably, the public was outraged at what they saw as excesses in the banking industry. And they wanted heads on a pike. And I became one of the heads,\" he says, adding: \"I think they could have chosen better ones.\"\n\nPeter Johnson says he would like to have his reputation restored\n\nCriminal authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, co-operating with lawyers working for Barclays, lined him up for prosecution.\n\nHe was not prosecuted for lowballing, but for manipulating rates on a much smaller scale by accepting requests from traders between 2005 and 2007 to nudge his Libor rates up or down very slightly.\n\nIn 2014, Johnson became the first banker to plead guilty to manipulating interest rates. But it was only because he felt the odds were against him and he had no choice. Barclays had cut him off from any financial support with his legal fees.\n\nBecause of the very high cost of defending himself, he feared he might lose his home, his savings and therefore his ability to support his children and grandchildren, even if he were found innocent.\n\n\"I didn't feel as if I'd done anything wrong. But I could see the way the whole thing was going and it didn't look good for me.\"\n\nJohnson, a 68-year-old grandfather, was sentenced in 2016 to four years and jailed alongside three other Barclays traders.\n\nHis first jail was HMP Wandsworth, which he describes as \"pretty basic, pretty horrible\".\n\n\"There was a shortage of prison officers... and there are some times when we were not let out of our cells, apart from for 10 minutes to get our meals, for 54 hours at a time.\"\n\nHe was later transferred to Ford open prison, where he decided to improve his fitness by walking around the perimeter of the prison, clocking up 6,000 miles and raising £3,000 for charity.\n\nIn the US, all 19 convictions for interest rate rigging are being overturned at the request of the DoJ - the same body that originally declared conduct like Johnson's to be illegal - following a US appeal court ruling that the prosecution case was misconceived.\n\nThe trader requests that Johnson was jailed for, it found, were not illegal - and didn't even break any rules. Many of those convictions arose from guilty pleas, made under the threat of prosecution in the US, which the DoJ no longer views as sound.\n\nThe UK is now the only country where making or accepting the requests is viewed as criminal. David Davis, John McDonnell and other MPs, peers and senior lawyers have written to the Times saying the cases must be sent back to the courts.\n\n\"In my most optimistic view, I would like my guilty plea to be revoked. I'd like to basically have my reputation restored. And I'd like senior people to be held accountable,\" says Johnson.\n\nAsked who they are, his reply is simple: \"The board of Barclays Bank, the Bank of England and the government of the UK.\"\n\nBarclays declined to comment for this article.\n\nA spokesperson for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Johnson, said its cases were based on evidence. It said nine bank traders knowingly rigged rates for their own benefit. \"Separate juries and the Court of Appeal agreed they committed a crime.\"\n\nA Bank of England spokesperson said: \"The Bank fully co-operated with the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into Libor manipulation, responding to all requests for information and documents.\"\n\nThe Treasury said in a statement: \"The government did not seek to influence individual bank Libor submissions.\"The Duchess of York has not been invited to King Charles's coronation next month, sources have confirmed.\n\nIt is understood that there is no \"ill will\" from the duchess, Sarah Ferguson, about this decision, who is said not to have expected to attend.\n\nBefore her divorce in 1996, she was married to the King's younger brother, Prince Andrew.\n\nHe is expected to be at the coronation on 6 May, along with more than 2,000 guests in Westminster Abbey.\n\nDetails of those who will be at the ceremony are beginning to emerge.\n\nSenior royals and politicians will be present, alongside 450 charity and community representatives and international dignitaries such as President Macron of France, US first lady Jill Biden and Crown Prince Akishino of Japan.\n\nPrince Harry this week confirmed that he would be travelling from the US for the coronation, but his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will not be attending.\n\nThere are denials that the decision not to invite the Duchess of York is a snub, when she has maintained good relations with her royal ex-in laws, including spending Easter with them this year.\n\nWhen",

Throughout it all, he retained his trademark direct humour and down-to-earth compassion.\n\nOne night in 1985, Paul O'Grady was working behind the bar at a gay pub in London when he remarked that he could do a better job of hosting ladies' night than the current compere.\n\n\"And they said, 'Well go on then, up you get and do it,' he recalled. \"And the following week I did it, and Lily was born.\"\n\nThat was the first appearance of Lily Savage, the sharp-tongued blonde bombshell alter ego who became famous before O'Grady himself was well known.\n\nThe comic character had been forming before that, though. O'Grady gained the nickname Shanghai Lil after attending a party on a Chinese ship at the age of 18 in Liverpool, and he would often amuse himself by impersonating Scouse housewives. \"So it was just an extension of that.\"\n\nO'Grady as Lily Savage, with his dog, on the red carpet at the Bafta Awards in 1998\n\nSavage was his mother's maiden name, and the character was also inspired by other tough but colourful women in his family.\n\nIn particular, there was Aunt Chrissie, a bus conductor with \"a mouth like a bee's arse\", as O'Grady put it on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.\n\n\"She was the talk of Birkenhead,\" he said. \"She was witty and had a great string of one-liners.

Inevitably he, and Indy, deserved better.\"\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks the first film in the franchise not to be directed by Steven Spielberg, with James Mangold (The Wolverine and Ford v Ferrari) taking the reins instead.\n\nThe director, who also previously made Girl Interrupted and Walk the Line, said he was aiming at the \"best version\" of what his childhood hero, Spielberg, had done with the four previous films.\n\nFord, pictured with Phoebe Waller-Bridge (left) received applause and a five-minute standing ovation at the film's Cannes premiere\n\nSpielberg, he told the AFP news agency, \"has been a hero of mine all my life\", adding: \"I saw the first Indiana Jones movie when I was 17. It's a big chair to sit in, but it was also a huge personal opportunity.\"\n\nHe said the new movie was \"me kind of emulating my mentor and trying to tell a story,\" adding: \"Of course, it's still me, and not him.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney opined that the film had \"a feel of something written by committee\". He said it \"does have is a sweet blast of pure nostalgia in the closing scene, a welcome reappearance foreshadowed with a couple visual clues early on.\"\n\nHowever, he added that \"part of what dims the enjoyment of this concluding chapter is just how glaringly fake so much of it looks\".\n\nTotal Film's James Mottram viewed things differently, noting that Indiana Jones \"goes out on a high.\"\n\n\"The action is slickly handled by Mangold, not least a thrilling tuk-tuk chase through Tangier. But best of all, this is an Indiana Jones film with tears in its eyes. We see the character has grown older, but not necessarily wiser.\n\n\"Drinking a bit too much, he's full of regrets about pursuing fortune and glory and leaving his loved ones behind.\"\n\nFord told the same film magazine last month that this would be \"the final film in the series\" and \"the last time I'll play the character.\"\n\nAnd while Disney is developing a TV series, Ford confirmed: \"I will not be involved in that, if it does come to fruition.\"\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is out in UK cinemas on 28 June.\n\nYou may also be interested in:Last updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nJust Stop Oil protesters caused a stoppage to rugby's Gallagher Premiership final by running on to the pitch and throwing orange paint powder.\n\nThe match between Sale and Saracens at Twickenham was briefly delayed when two men ran from the stands.\n\nStewards escorted the protesters away to cheers from the crowd, and the men were later arrested.\n\nIt was the latest sporting event to be affected after play was halted at the World Snooker Championship in April.\n\nA man climbed on to a table at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre and covered it in orange powder as another protester tried to glue herself to the second table.

I'd make my own out of pots and pans and kettles and hit them with a spoon.\n\nAnd where did the stage name come from?\n\nKäärijä, if I had to translate, it means a \"roller\" or a \"moneymaker\", something like that.\n\nIs that a reference to your sideline as a semi-professional gambler?\n\nYeah, yeah. I played hockey for many years, and I play at gambling too. The first song I released in Finland told the story of my gambling.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

You have to show faith in yourself!\n\nMaybe, but if I don't win the contest, then I don't get any money. If I put my money on Loreen [Sweden's entrant, who is the current favourite], then maybe I'll win something!\n\nI know Loreen is the favourite but you are creeping up in the odds. How does that feel?\n\nIt feels great because Loreen is a queen, she's a superstar.\n\nYou met her recently. What was that like?\n\nShe's a very calm person, very serene. We had so much fun together.

This didn't shift the dial.\n\nPerhaps the most eyebrow-raising reason given by the government for not budging came from then-cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi, who suggested in December that nurses would be helping out Vladimir Putin if they took industrial action.\n\nIn the end, however, ministers worked out a deal with the RCN they hoped would be seen as a benchmark for other industrial disputes.\n\nIronically, it's the RCN deal that has fallen at this important hurdle, souring the mood.\n\nThe leader of one of the other big unions suggests the government \"thought boxing off the RCN was a clever move, but it's just not the way unions work …they were more focused on the PR than industrial relations\".\n\nSo far, there has been no significant contact between the government and the RCN since Friday's announcement of further strikes.\n\nThe health secretary is yet to reply to the RCN's letter asking for urgent talks.\n\nA few informal suggestions have been made, about the possibility of what's been described as a few \"sweeteners\", even an idea of helping nurses with their parking costs.\n\nThe notion, at this stage, that a few tweaks here and there will solve the dispute seems far fetched.\n\nJunior doctors are set for further industrial action\n\nDowning Street is reluctant to say much about what is going on with the RCN until all the health unions have had their say on the deal. That is not for another couple of weeks.\n\nA government source said ministers' \"general stance had been a sober reflection of what's affordable\", and that broadly they believe they are \"getting the right balance\", with inflation eating away at everybody's wages.\n\nBut the fight with the RCN, which ministers hoped had been resolved, makes the atmosphere between the government and unions even more fraught.\n\nThere is little sign of a deal with the teaching unions, set to strike soon. There's the ongoing dispute with junior doctors, who could end up on strike at the same time as nurses in England.\n\nCivil servants are likely to walk out too, having missed out on a one off payment for 2022/3, which other workers had been granted.\n\nDave Penman, leader of the FDA civil service union, warns the consequence will be a \"prolonged and damaging dispute\".\n\nAnother union leader told me the government has to confront a \"sense of burning anger\" among public sector workers if they want to bring this series of disputes to an end.\n\nThe public disruption of course has a political cost too. Not just because of the inconvenience and risks from the action itself, most profound in the health service, but the wider consequences for Rishi Sunak.\n\nRemember, he has asked you to judge him on five specific promises - one of them to bring NHS waiting lists down, which hospital bosses warn is impossible for as long as industrial action is taking place.\n\nAnother is to get the economy growing which, the Office for National Statistics said this week, was not happening, partly because of strikes taking place.\n\nAllowing industrial action to continue makes it harder for the prime minister to achieve his targets, dampening Conservative hopes of some kind of political recovery.\n\nRishi Sunak's supporters have pointed gleefully to an apparent tightening of the opinion polls in recent weeks, a dire situation looking, by some measures, slightly less bad.\n\nThe approaching local elections, which used to be pointed to as some kind of potential moment of Armageddon for his leadership, now seem less of a moment of jeopardy.\n\nBut rolling industrial action which will hit real lives presents serious political risks for the PM.\n\nAnd right now there seems no easy solution to what could be a summer of strikes.This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of losing control of court services and letting violent criminals go free because of record backlogs.\n\nThe Labour leader said the Tories had taken a \"wrecking ball\" to the criminal justice system.\n\nBut Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Sir Keir was \"soft on criminals\".\n\nHe added that his party had toughened up sentencing powers so criminals spent longer in prison.\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir attacked Mr Sunak personally for the state of the criminal justice system.\n\n\"Can't the prime minister see because they have lost control of the court service, because they have created the largest court backlog on record, he is letting violent criminals go free?\" the Labour leader asked.\n\nCrown Courts in England and Wales ended last year with a backlog of 61,737 cases - the highest year-end figure on record, although down from a peak in the autumn.\n\nBut Mr Sunak hit back, accusing Sir Keir of watering down punishments when he sat on the sentencing council, which issues guidelines to courts, in his previous role as director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"That's why they call him Sir Softy. Soft on crime. Soft on criminals,\" he added.\n\nSir Keir also highlighted the case of a convicted people-smuggler who threw boiling water over a prison officer in 2019, leaving him with first-degree burns.\n\nThe individual was not jailed for the attack as he was given a suspended sentence.\n\nThe Labour leader referenced a court judgement from last month, which cited the fact it took 16 months for the attacker to be charged and two years for him to be sentenced, as well as prison overcrowding, as among the reasons for the decision.\n\nSir Keir described the circumstances of the case as \"completely unacceptable\", adding: \"Anyone watching this would wonder why someone who violently attacks a key worker isn't behind bars.\"\n\nMr Sunak responded by criticising Labour for voting against the Sentencing Act last year, which ended automatic early release for the most serious violent offenders half-way through their sentence.\n\nIt comes after Labour put out a number of adverts on Twitter last week, attacking Mr Sunak's record on crime.\n\nOne advert, which claimed the prime minister did not think adults convicted of child sex assaults should go to prison, attracted controversy and was criticised by opposition parties and some Labour figures.\n\nLabour has sought to make crime a focus of its campaigning ahead of May's local elections in England.\n\nLib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael also criticised the government's record on prosecuting criminals as \"a disaster\".\n\n\"Under Conservative ministers the court backlog has spiralled out of control and denies victims the timely justice they deserve,\" he said.Eleanor Williams is awaiting sentence for eight counts of perverting the course of justice.\n\nA woman who falsely claimed she was raped and trafficked by an Asian grooming gang has launched an appeal against her conviction.\n\nEleanor Williams, 22, of Barrow-in-Furness, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice in January.\n\nShe posted photos on social media of injuries she said were from beatings but had inflicted them on herself.\n\nWilliams is yet to be sentenced and the Ministry of Justice said the appeal process is in \"the early stages\".\n\nHer Facebook post in May 2020 was shared more than 100,000 times and sparked demonstrations in her home town in Cumbria.\n\nThe 10-week trial at Preston Crown Court was told the post was the \"finale\" to her story and she had accused a number of men of rape, going back to 2017.\n\nShe had told police she was consistently groomed and trafficked by Asian men.\n\nOn May 19 2020 she was found by officers near her home on Walney Island with injuries which she claimed were inflicted by a gang after she was taken to a house in the town and raped.\n\nBut the prosecution claimed Williams caused the injuries to herself with a hammer, which was found with her blood on close by.\n\nThe photos of her injuries went viral on social media\n\nThe trial heard Williams went online to \"effectively find random names\" to present as either victims or perpetrators of trafficking.\n\nSome of the people she made allegations about were real",

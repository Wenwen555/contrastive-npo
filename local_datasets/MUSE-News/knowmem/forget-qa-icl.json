Here are some of our stories on the leaks:\n\nA former senior civil servant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the exchanges published by the Telegraph did not necessarily tell the whole story.\n\nBut discussing government business on WhatsApp in this way suggested \"a lack of professionalism\", not least because the messages can be made public.\n\n\"It does seem to display a laxity in the decision-making process. with decisions being made for, frankly, emotional, personal, or 'small p' political reasons\", he said of Mr Case's exchanges with Mr Hancock.\n\nSome of this may be down to Mr Case's \"inexperience\" as a senior civil servant, he suggested, and his apparent desire to act as \"courtier\" to ministers, rather than an impartial adviser.\n\n\"As a cabinet secretary, you don't need to curry favour, to be seen to be 'on side' with ministers, in this case Matt Hancock,\" said the former civil servant.\n\nIt was, he suggested, \"illustrative, perhaps, of a lack of grip on the job\" and he would not be surprised if Mr Case was considering quitting.\n\n\"There is wisdom in choosing the time of your own departure and maybe that is something he will be thinking about.\"\n\nThe messages are part of trove of more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages leaked to the Telegraph by journalist Isabel Oakeshott.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify the messages, which were supplied to Ms Oakeshott in confidence by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\nMr Hancock has said they offer an \"entirely partial account\" of the government's handling of the pandemic.Last updated on .From the section Snooker\n\nCoverage: Watch live on BBC TV and Red Button with uninterrupted coverage on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and the BBC Sport app\n\nMark Selby created history as he became the first player to make a maximum 147 break in a World Championship final.\n\nBut the four-time world champion trails Luca Brecel 9-8 going into Monday's last day of action.\n\n\"The atmosphere when I potted that final black was electric. It is incredible. Just to make a 147 here is hard enough,\" said 39-year-old Selby.\n\n\"I always thought that if I got in that position I would be shaking like a leaf. It was amazing how calm I felt.\"\n\nBelgium's Brecel had dominated the opening session with his flamboyant attacking style to open up a 6-2 advantage.\n\nHowever, Selby, who appeared jaded on Sunday afternoon as a consequence of the draining late-night finish to his semi-final victory over Mark Allen, delivered a superb riposte in an exhilarating second session.\n\nA high-quality start saw Selby finally display his devastating potting ability, opening with a 134 break and then a 96 as he reeled off three of the first four frames.\n\nBrecel, who crafted a brilliant 99 of his own in the 10th frame of the match, constructed back-to-back half centuries to re-establish a four-frame lead at 9-5.\n\nBut Selby again responded, pinching the final frame of the session after his 147 to leave snooker's blue-riband event delicately poised when play resumes at 13:00 BST on Monday.\n\nSelby's special effort arrived in the 16th frame of the match, with the Englishman coming to the table after Brecel had left a red hanging in the jaws of the bottom corner pocket.\n\nAs excitement built he went on to superbly pot a difficult final red with the rest to clear all 15 reds, all accompanied by blacks, before dispatching the colours.\n\nIt prompted joyous scenes as the fans inside the auditorium erupted.\n\nReferee Brendan Moore, officiating in his third and last Crucible final before retirement, congratulated Selby, who was also embraced warmly by Brecel.\n\nSelby's feat comes 40 years on from the first ever maximum at the Crucible, compiled by Cliff Thorburn in 1983.\n\nThe Englishman is the 10th player to achieve a total clearance at the Sheffield venue - Kyren Wilson also made a 147 earlier in the tournament.\n\nThere have been 14 maximums in total at the Crucible with Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry making three each.\n\nThe select band of players to reach the magical tally is completed by Cliff Thorburn, Jimmy White, Mark Williams, Ali Carter, John Higgins and Neil Robertson.\n\nWilson's 147 came during his 10-5 first-round win against Ryan Day.\n\nSelby is set to share with him an additional £55,000 in prize money, with £40,000 on offer for a 147 and £15,000 for the tournament's highest break.\n\nIt was amazing, to be here and have a bird's eye view of it, it's a magical moment in Crucible history.\n\nTo make a maximum in a final is just the icing on the cake for Mark Selby in his career.\n\nPhenomenal. Iconic pictures. The irony that during the interval we were running a piece about Cliff Thorburn [making the Crucible's first maximum in 1983] and celebrating the anniversary of that, to then a couple of frames later [for Selby to make one].\n\nIt was absolutely amazing. What a competitor. To then follow that up by winning the final frame, that is absolutely vital. A very interesting day that we're set up for tomorrow.Primary school children in England have ranked fourth in the international rankings for reading.\n\nThe latest results in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study - known as Pirls - saw England's rank jump from eighth to enter the top five.\n\nBased on tests taken every five years, the study places countries in a global education league table.\n\nThe Pirls tests are taken by nine and 10-year-olds, normally Year 5 pupils in England, at the end of the school year.\n\nThe 2021 testing round assessed nearly 400,000 pupils in 57 countries.\n\nBut 14 of those - including Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - delayed testing to the start of the next school year because of disruption caused by the Covid pandemic, meaning the students taking part were older.\n\nThe International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which runs the study, said direct comparisons with those 14 countries should be made \"with great care\".\n\nWhen included in comparisons, Northern Ireland ranked fifth - up from joint sixth in the previous round of testing.\n\nThe IEA said England could be reliably compared with other countries even though it pushed back testing until 2022 to avoid Covid disruption, because it tested the same age group as the other countries.\n\nIn those rankings, Singapore scored the highest result, with an average score of 587.\n\nSecond was Hong Kong with an average score of 573, followed by Russia (567) and England (558).\n\nWales and Scotland do not submit results to Pirls but Scotland is set to join the next cycle.\n\nSchools minister Nick Gibb said England's success was aided by government reforms, including a focus on phonics, which teaches children to read using sounds, and to teachers \"putting reading at the heart of everything they do\".\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the \"excellent results\" were \"a badly needed piece of good news for an education system that feels beleaguered\".\n\nHe said the success was testament to the \"hard work, skill and dedication of primary school teachers and leaders\".\n\nOverall, girls were ahead of boys in their reading achievement in nearly all of the ranked countries, but the gender gap has narrowed in the most recent testing round.\n\nThe Pirls results came days after a Year 6 Sats reading paper, which some parents said was so hard it left children in tears.\n\nMr Gibb said the assess",

Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police\n\nThe killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up.\n\nAn only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league.\n\nHis education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician.\n\nThose who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father.\n\nHis record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record.\n\nHe had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\".\n\nShortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence.\n\n\"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\"\n\nHis grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\".\n\n\"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen.\n\nThe programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician.\n\nOvale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\".\n\n\"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien.\n\nHe praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media.\n\nHe had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate.\n\nShortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters.\n\nHis mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\"\n\n\"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium.\n\nFlowers were left at the site where Nahel died\n\n\"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel.\n\nBut the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice.\n\n\"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtempérer - refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nWhen he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.\n\nHis name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations.\n\nLast September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\". Most of the trouble he got into involved cars: driving without a licence or insurance and using false number plates.\n\nBut Nahel had never been convicted, said family lawyer Jennifer Cambla, and had no criminal record. Being known to police was not the same as a criminal record, because he had never been tried for anything listed on his police file, she told French TV.\n\n\"I think in this kind of suburb it's pretty rare that a young person hasn't been stopped by police or hasn't been in custody,\" Ms Cambla said.\n\nThe riots that his death has provoked are a reminder for many in France of the events of 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, were electrocuted as they fled police after a game of football and ran into an electricity substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois.\n\n\"It could have been me, it could have been my little brother,\" a Clichy teenager called Mohammed told French website Mediapart.South Wales Police is set to start reusing technology ruled unlawful in 2020\n\nCivil rights groups have claimed facial recognition technology will make racism within the police worse.\n\nSouth Wales Police is set to restart using the controversial technology after an independent review said it was not discriminatory.\n\nBut Liberty said history showed it would \"always be used disproportionately against communities of colour\".\n\nThe force insisted the technology would be used responsibly.\n\nLive facial recognition enables police to find people at big events suspected of committing crimes.\n\nIn 2020, appeal court judges ruled a trial project to scan thousands of faces by South Wales Police was unlawful.\n\nThe force had paused its use of the technology amid concerns over discrimination, but will resume in the wake of a report commissioned in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIt found there were minimal discrepancies for race and sex when the technology is used at certain settings.\n\nAn independent review said the technology was not discriminatory\n\nLiberty, which describes itself as \"the UK's largest civil liberties organisation,\" said the technology was oppressive and had no place in a democracy.\n\n\"Our ability to express ideas, communicate with others and engage in democratic processes will be undermined by technology such as facial recognition,\" said campaigns manager Emmanuelle Andrews.\n\n\"The expansion of mass surveillance tools has no place on the streets of a rights respecting democracy.\"\n\nSouth Wales Police chief constable Jeremy",

The company leaks more water than any other water company in UK, losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic size swimming pools every day from its pipes.\n\nIts chief executive, Sarah Bentley, resigned last week, weeks after she was asked to forgo her bonus over the company's handling of sewage spills.\n\nThames Water is a private company, owned by a group of investors, with the largest being the Canadian pension fund, OMERS, with 31.8%.\n\nOMERS has declined to comment on the water firm's current situation, but USS, a pension fund for UK academics and the second biggest investor with a 19.7% stake, is the first to announce its support.\n\n\"We have given our backing to Thames Water's turnaround plan and Net Zero roadmap and engage with them regularly to support their long-term strategy,\" Mr Galvin said in note to staff, which was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\n\"We remain of the view that, with an appropriate regulatory environment, the long-term objective of repairing important UK infrastructure and paying pensions to our members are in strong alignment.\"\n\nThames Water said last week that it was trying to raise the cash it needs to improve.\n\nIt said it was keeping water regulator Ofwat informed on progress, and that it still had \"strong\" cash and borrowing reserves to draw on.\n\nThe government has said it was ready to act in a worst case scenario if Thames Water collapsed.\n\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies will continue as normal to customers.\n\nLast year Thames Water's owners - including USS - pumped £500m into the business and pledged a further £1bn to help it to improve.\n\nBut the company is understood to be struggling to raise the remaining cash which it needs to service its substantial debt pile, which is around £14bn. Interest payments on more than half of its debt are linked to the rate of inflation, which has soared over the last year.\n\nOther water firms are also facing similar pressures due to higher interest payments on their debts and rising costs including higher energy and chemical prices.Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.\n\nRetired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.\n\nThe IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.\n\nThe military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.\n\nBy the end, all the aid workers were dead.\n\nThe IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening.\n\nIt also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.\n\nThree of the charity's cars were struck during the attack\n\nThe evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.\n\nIn addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.\n\nThe IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.\n\nThe aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.\n\nDuring this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.\n\nAt this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.\n\nThe drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility.\n\nMeanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.\n\nThe drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one",

These 30-plus screens in Hong Kong are the only ones with such issues.\"\n\nThe horror movie has received a score of just 4% on film rating site Rotten Tomatoes. It depicts the bear, known for being kind and honest, as a vengeful axe wielding half-man, half-bear.\n\nIt went viral online when the trailer was released.\n\nFrake-Waterfield was able to make the film when the 95-year copyright on Milne's first Winnie the Pooh story elapsed in the US in January last year.\n\nBut Disney - which bought some licences in the 1960s - still owns certain rights.

known as self-identification - instead.\n\nThe government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.\n\nLabour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\n\nSir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to \"introduce self-declaration\" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an \"important part\" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.\n\n\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.\n\nShe added that Labour wanted to avoid the \"mistakes\" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.\n\nScottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a \"cavalier approach\", she added.\n\nHowever, she added the current requirement to apply to an \"anonymous\" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it \"demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice\".\n\nInstead, she said it \"should be enough\" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.\n\nThe LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a \"huge step forward\" for trans people over the current government stance.\n\nBut it added the party was \"signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election\".\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to \"externally verify\" someone's acquired gender.\n\nRosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the \"core thing\" demanded by women's groups.\n\nMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges and prisons.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she called for more clarity on the party's position ahead of the general election, expected next year, adding it still included a \"bit of confusion and a bit of fence-sitting\".\n\nWomen and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said Labour's new position is a \"copy and paste\" of the government's position.\n\nAdding that some Labour MPs had previously attacked the Conservative position as prejudiced, she accused the party of \"bare-faced hypocrisy\".Heathrow Airport has said that some passengers may face security delays over the Easter holidays due to strike action over pay.\n\nHundreds of security officers in the Unite union, who work for Heathrow Airport, have begun 10 days of industrial action.\n\nIt threatens disruption at the UK's largest airport at the start of the Easter school holidays.\n\nHowever, Heathrow said the airport was operating \"as normal\" on Friday.\n\nThe strike involves security guards at Terminal 5, which is only used by British Airways, and those who check cargo. Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.\n\nHeathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than £1,000.\n\nThe airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.\n\nHowever, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.\n\nPicket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being \"well supported\".\n\nHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC \"many\" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but \"a lot\" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside \"hundreds\" of managers who were \"here to help\".\n\n\"The airport is operating as normal,\" he said.\n\nAre you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.\n\nThe next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.\n\nAhead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.\n\nBritish Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.\n\nThe strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.\n\nHeathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.\n\nTravellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.\n\nPassengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.\n\nThe aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused",

In January, it said fees would be frozen at £9,250 for the next two years.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats want to bring back maintenance grants, which were abandoned in 2016, and set up a review of how higher education is financed.\n\nThe Green Party, which favours scrapping fees, criticised Sir Keir's move, with co-leader Adrian Ramsay saying students would pay a \"heavy price\" as a result of \"the latest U-turn from Keir Starmer's Labour\".An open letter signed by dozens of academics from around the world calls on artificial-intelligence developers to learn more about consciousness, as AI systems become more advanced.\n\n\"It is no longer in the realm of science fiction to imagine AI systems having feelings and even human-level consciousness,\" it says.\n\nMost experts agree AI is nowhere near this level of sophistication.\n\nBut it is evolving rapidly and some say developments should be paused.\n\nThe term AI covers computer systems able to do tasks that would normally need human intelligence. This includes chatbots able to understand questions and respond with human-like answers, and systems capable of recognising objects in pictures.\n\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), an AI system developed by ChatGPT chatbot creator OpenAI, can now successfully complete the bar exam, the professional qualification for lawyers, although it still makes mistakes and can share misinformation.\n\nBut this is just one function of AI. AI products are being deployed in many sectors, including health research, marketing and finance.\n\nTechnology billionaire Elon Musk co-signed a recent letter saying further AI developments should be put on hold until effective safety measures could be designed and implemented.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, his ex-wife, Tallulah Riley, tweeted artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI capable of human-level intellectual tasks - needed \"the equivalent of [environmental activist] Greta Thunberg\" to raise awareness and encourage public debate.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science (AMCS), which has compiled the open letter, titled \"The responsible development of AI agenda needs to include consciousness research\", said it did not have a view on whether AI development in general should be paused.\n\nBut it pushed for a greater scientific understanding of consciousness, how it could apply to AI and how society might live alongside it.\n\n\"The rapid development of AI is exposing the urgent need to accelerate research in the field of consciousness science,\" the letter says.\n\nIts signatories include Dr Susan Schneider, a former NASA professor, as well as academics from universities in the UK, US and Europe.\n\nLast year, a Google engineer was fired after claiming an AI system was sentient.\n\nGoogle has maintained Lamda was doing exactly what it had been programmed to do - communicate in a human-like way.\n\nBut Google boss Sundar Pichai recently told US news platform CBS he did not \"fully understand\" how Bard worked.\n\nThe human mind was not fully understood either, he added, which is why the AMCS is calling for more research.\n\nBut there is as much excitement as nervousness around AI. It is the big buzzword in big tech and investment money is pouring in to AI-related projects.\n\nReleased in November, ChatGPT, became an instant viral sensation, the populist \"face\" of AI, with millions of people trying it out.\n\nUsing the internet as a database, it can give written answers to questions in a natural, human-like way.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested heavily in OpenAI, says AI can take \"the drudgery\" out of mundane jobs such as office administration.\n\nA recent report by Goldman Sachs suggests AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.\n\nAnd while the AI industry will create new human jobs, they are likely to require new skills.Junior doctors in Scotland have been offered a 14.5% pay rise.\n\nThe new offer from the Scottish government, which covers a two-year period, was made after negotiations with BMA Scotland.\n\nThe union will now consult its members, who voted in favour of strike action earlier this month, on the offer.\n\nBMA Scotland stressed it had not agreed the improved deal - but said that it was likely to be the best that the Scottish government would offer.\n\nMinisters said they were proposing a £61.3m investment in junior doctor pay, which they described as the largest in 20 years and the best offer in the UK.\n\nThe government said that if it was accepted, there would be a pay rise of 6.5% in 2023/24 and an additional 3% towards an already agreed 4.5% uplift in 2022/23.\n\nThis amounts to a cumulative increase of 14.5% over two years and matches the recent pay award accepted by nurses and other NHS workers in 2023, it said.\n\nBMA Scotland members had previously voted in favour of staging a 72-hour walkout. The union has been calling for a 23.5% increase above inflation.\n\nMore than 71% of the eligible 5,000 junior doctors in Scotland voted in that ballot, with 97% in favour of industrial action.\n\nScotland's Health Secretary Michael Matheson said he was \"delighted\" to have reached an agreement with the BMA Scotland after weeks of intense negotiations.\n\nHe added: \"We have taken their concerns regarding pay, and the need to modernise pay bargaining more broadly, extremely seriously.\n\n\"It's now up to junior doctors to reflect on this final offer, and I hope they will accept.\"\n\nBMA Scotland said it would put the offer to its members in a consultative vote.\n\nDr Chris Smith, who chairs its Scottish junior doctor committee, stressed that the BMA had not agreed the deal or accepted any offer.\n\n\"However, the offer that has been made is without doubt an improvement on the 4.5% awarded last year, and the improved offer for 22/23 would represent a slowdown in doctors' pay erosion, which had accelerated up to this point after 15 years of real terms decline,\" he said.\n\n\"Our commitment to the long-term aim of righting that historical wrong remains firmly in place and will continue to be a top priority going forwards.\n\n\"We feel this offer reflects the best that the Scottish government will offer after this series of negotiations. This is why it is essential our members decide our next steps.\"\n\nMichael Matheson said he hoped junior doctors would accept the offer\n\nJunior doctors - fully-qualified medics who are not specialty staff doctors, consultants or GPs - make up 44% of the doctors in the NHS in Scotland.\n\nJunior doctors in England walked out for three days in March and four days in April, leading to the cancellation of more than 196,000 hospital appointments last month.\n\nIn January, ambulance staff belonging to three unions - GMB, Unison and Unite - staged a strike in England and Wales in a dispute over pay",

Earlier, a private jet linked to Prigozhin was tracked landing in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\n\nOn Saturday, mercenary troops led by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin took over the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, marched on Moscow and shot down Russian military helicopters and a plane on their way.\n\nTheir mutiny was later aborted after a deal was struck with the help of Mr Lukashenko.\n\nThe Russian authorities said Wagner will be disarmed but its members will escape prosecution over its short-lived rebellion.\n\n\"We always treated fighters and commanders from this group with great respect, because they really showed bravery and heroism,\" said Mr Putin.\n\nHe said authorities would look into how the money paid to Wagner and its leader was spent.\n\nPreparations are under way for the group to hand over its heavy weapons and equipment to the Russian army, the defence ministry said.\n\nCriminal charges have also been dropped against those who took part in the mutiny, according to the FSB security service.\n\nWagner members were facing prosecution for armed insurrection, but the case has been closed because the mutineers had stopped short of actually committing a crime, the FSB said.\n\nIts fighters can either join the regular army, go home or head for Belarus, Mr Putin said on Monday, adding that the fighters were mostly \"patriots\" who had been misled into a criminal adventure.\n\nMr Lukashenko said Belarus has not started building any camps for members of the group, but will accommodate them if they want.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr Putin told Russian troops in Moscow their actions during the mutiny had prevented a \"civil war\" and held a minute's silence for those killed.\n\nHe insisted that the Wagner forces never had the support of the army or the people, although crowds cheered and applauded Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don.\n\nThe treatment of the mercenaries stands in marked contrast to the treatment of opposition politicians and activists, many of whom are in prison simply for speaking out against the war in Ukraine.\n\nOpposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, for example, is serving 25 years for treason.\n\nBy contrast, Wagner chief Prigozhin and the armed men who took part in the rebellion are seemingly being allowed to go free.\n\nPrigozhin has defended his actions, insisting the revolt was not meant to be a challenge to the leadership of Mr Putin.\n\nRather, he described it as a bid to save his mercenary group from being absorbed into the Russian army, and to expose the failures of the country's military leadership.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

so it is disappointing.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Wilson said she understood the reason behind the decision.\n\n\"I think ultimately safety of mothers and babies especially giving birth is the main goal and priority here,\" she added.\n\nThe Department of Health said: \"Conditions of the approval include making planned capacity changes at Antrim Hospital as outlined in the public consultation.\"\n\nThe trust will also be required to prioritise the development of an interim three-bedded alongside midwife-led unit at Antrim.\n\nA protest was held in Coleraine in May against the cuts to Causeway Hospital maternity services\n\nThe department said this will offer additional capacity in advance of longer-term plans for a new-build women and children's unit.\n\nSetting out the department's decision-making process, Mr May said he had reviewed the trust's consultation outcome in line with its policy and guidance on change or withdrawal of service.\n\n\"It is also consistent with the wider health transformation agenda which acknowledges that changes need to be made to ensure sustainability of services,\" he said.\n\nThe trust said it was committed to maintaining acute services and an Emergency Department at the site.\n\n\"We recognise that the hospital and its staff play a vital role in serving the local community, and we want to enhance rather than diminish that role.\"\n\nThe trust added: \"Causeway Hospital will retain its high quality antenatal and postnatal care which we recognise are critical local services for women.\n\n\"We will also be enhancing these services so that pregnant women will have access to complex antenatal care and clinics at Causeway Hospital.\"\n\nGregory Campbell, the MP for East Londonderry, said he was \"disturbed\" by the trust's explanation for the move.\n\nHe said: \"The inability to staff hospital wards and in this case a maternity unit, points to a planning and management failure more than lack of need in the community.\"\n\nMr Campbell said the Northern Trust and DoH must spell out the sustainability of the Causeway Hospital.\n\nThe proposals had been met with some opposition over the last number of months.\n\nAbout 100 people gathered in Coleraine town centre after the Northern Trust approved the recommendation to remove births from the hospital in May.\n\nIn June Mother-of-three, Heidi Wright from Portrush, said she was concerned about the length of time it would take to travel to Antrim.\n\nIn less than a year, the Northern Trust has managed to deliver a major permanent change to how one of its core services will be delivered with little fuss or opposition.\n\nIn Northern Ireland that is remarkable.\n\nWhile for decades transforming health care has been much talked about, in practice little has happened.\n\nMost recently, and in 2016, Prof Rafael Bengoa said Northern Ireland faced \"a stark choice\".\n\nThe man who chaired the last local healthcare review said people could \"either resist change and see services deteriorate to the point of collapse over time, or embrace transformation and work to create a modern sustainable service\".\n\nAt present, these two contrasting viewpoints are being played out across three different health trusts.\n\nIn the Southern and Western Trusts, resisting change over many years at Daisy Hill and the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) has now triggered a rush to transform how some services are being delivered, a move likened by the BMA to \"falling off the cliff edge\".\n\nSome have said that the change feels \"unplanned and out of control\".\n\nPoliticians have led rallies and debates in protest.\n\nBut in the Northern Trust the picture is different.\n\nOfficials have said that before maternity services get to to the point of \"collapse\" they are implementing change that is planned, deliberate and intentional.\n\nWhile all the health trusts conducted consultations, it seems that Causeway will be able to consolidate all births at Antrim Area Hospital while maintaining an antenatal and post-natal assessment hub at Causeway.\n\nIt hasn't been without some public protest - but nowhere near the extent of that seen in Enniskillen and Newry.\n\nAll other health trusts must be looking to the Northern Trust in wonder.\n\nHow did it do what the Southern and Western trusts couldn't?\n\nThe big difference, it seems, is the lack of political interference at Causeway.\n\nIn 2016, the then health minister - the DUP's Simon Hamilton - said political consensus was key to the future of NI's health service.\n\nIt seems that is much easier said than done.A surgeon who had to amputate a man's arm after a dog attack in Banbridge has said the victim's injuries were almost fatal.\n\nAlastair Brown, a plastic surgeon based at Belfast's Ulster Hospital, said the patient's wounds were among the worst he had seen.\n\nHe was in hospital for two months after the attack in October last year.\n\nMr Brown, who amputated the victim's left arm, said his injuries were so severe it was a case of",

Watch: Michael Gove says the Ukraine war and Covid pandemic made the UK poorer\n\nThe UK is poorer than it would have been, partly due to the war in Ukraine, but also the pandemic, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has admitted.\n\nBut he said ministers were taking action on the soaring cost of living, including giving help on energy bills.\n\nThe head of the independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said living standards were seeing their biggest squeeze on record.\n\nRichard Hughes said Brexit had been similar to the pandemic in its impact.\n\n\"It's a shock to the UK economy of the order of magnitude to other shocks that we've seen from the pandemic, from the energy crisis,\" he told the BBC.\n\nPoor productivity had also hurt growth, he said.\n\nAnd he warned living standards would not return to pre-pandemic levels for another five to six years.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with the OBR's assessments, Mr Gove said economic forecasting was \"a very difficult exercise\". He added that the UK was dealing with \"the aftershocks of two significant events\".\n\n\"[There's] both the war in Ukraine, the first time we've had war on this scale on the continent in Europe since the Second World War, and the Covid pandemic, the biggest global health pandemic since the end of the First World War,\" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\n\"They have had a huge effect on our economy and on others' economies.\"\n\nMr Gove denied that the government was to blame after 13 years in power, but added: \"One can always do better, yes.\"\n\nHowever, he insisted ministers were taking action to address soaring inflation - the rate at which prices rise - by taxing oil and gas firms' profits and lowering household energy bills.\n\nHe also said the Budget had taken steps to help people back to work and to help families, including with childcare.\n\nThe OBR forecasts that inflation will fall below 3% this year - down from 10.4% currently - as food and energy prices rise less quickly.\n\nBut speaking on the same programme, OBR chairman Richard Hughes said the outlook was volatile given Britain was a net importer of food and energy - the prices of which were set in global markets.\n\nMr Hughes added that the longer term outlook for the economy was bleak, with people's real spending power - allowing for inflation - not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade.\n\nMr Hughes blamed a range of issues for holding back the economy, saying: \"We've lost around 500,000 people from the labour force, we've seen stagnant investment since 2016 and also our productivity has slowed dramatically since the financial crisis and not really recovered.\"\n\nHe also said that overall output was forecast to be 4% lower than it would have been as a result of leaving the EU.\n\nLast week the Bank of England put up interest rates for the 11th time since December 2021 as it continued its battle to ease inflation.\n\nThe decision to lift rates to 4.25% from 4% came after the inflation rate rose unexpectedly last month to 10.4%.Steve Rodhouse - who has since gone on to work for the National Crime Agency - was a senior figure at the Met\n\nThe officer who led a disastrous Scotland Yard investigation into false VIP sex abuse allegations has a case to answer for gross misconduct, the police watchdog has said.\n\nSteve Rodhouse ran an operation that probed invented claims that MPs and generals abused and murdered children.\n\nHe currently works as deputy head of the National Crime Agency.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) looked at if he used inaccurate or dishonest words in 2016.\n\nWhile working for the Met, he oversaw Operation Midland, which was largely based on claims made by Carl Beech, who was jailed in 2019 for making false allegations.\n\nBeech was sentenced to 18 years in prison for 12 charges of perverting the course of justice, one of fraud, and for several child sexual offences.\n\nHe was only brought to justice after a damning review by retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques recommended he be investigated by another police force.\n\nBut the BBC revealed two other complainants who made false claims were not referred by the Met for investigation, despite Sir Richard recommending they should be.\n\nIn 2016, then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse told Sir Richard in a private presentation that he was \"satisfied\" the other two complainants had \"told deliberate lies\".\n\nHowever, when Operation Midland closed months earlier, Scotland Yard issued a public statement to the media which said detectives had \"not found evidence to prove that they were knowingly misled by a complainant\".\n\nCarl Beech was jailed for inventing the elaborate lies which led to the investigation\n\nThe investigation by the IOPC related to the contrast between Mr Rodhouse's private and public positions.\n\nScotland Yard said \"we will seek to respond as fully and comprehensively as possible when we receive the final directions and recommendations from the IOPC\".\n\nThe force added that, in January this year, it arranged for West Midlands Police to consider all relevant material relating to the two complainants and advise on further investigation.\n\nThe IOPC inquiry followed a complaint by former MP Harvey Proctor, who was one of those falsely accused of murder and abuse.\n\nResponding to the update, he said: \"At last a senior police officer of the Metropolitan Police is being held to account for gross misconduct\".\n\nHe added: \"As cracks start to appear in the police cover-up, it now time to hold a full public inquiry into Operation Midland and the Metropolitan Police's conduct.\"\n\nIOPC Director Amanda Rowe said Mr Rodhouse \"may have breached police professional standards of behaviour relating to honesty and integrity regarding comments made to the media about Operation Midland in March 2016 and comments subsequently made to Sir Richard Henriques in August 2016.\"\n\nThe IOPC also found that, by never following Sir Richard's original recommendation, the service provided by the Met was \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe Met had conducted several internal reviews which all said no investigation was needed, but the IOPC found those reviews were \"flawed, did not consider all of the evidence and their rationales were not sound.\"\n\nThe watchdog has recommended the Met apologise to the individuals affected.\n\nBecause Mr Rodhouse left the Met more than 12 months before the IOPC investigation began, the watchdog said it would now enter into a consultation period regarding a disciplinary hearing.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it would engage with the IOPC \"fully on this matter\".Corfu has become the latest Greek island to issue an evacuation order, as the country grapples with wildfires.\n\nPhotos uploaded to social media show flames engulfing Corfu. A fire broke out on the northern part of the island which is popular with British tourists.\n\nIt comes after some 19,000 people were evacuated on the island of Rhodes, which has also been hit by fires.\n\nMany were forced to flee their hotels as the flames continued to spread from the centre of the Greek island.\n\nGreece has been grappling with searing heat, with temperatures exceeding 40C across the country, and fires have blazed for nearly a week in some areas.\n\nA national holiday that had been planned for Monday has been cancelled \"in view of the extraordinary conditions prevailing in the country due to the fires\", the Greek presidency said.\n\nLate on Sunday evening Greece's Emergency Communications Service published evacuation orders for a number of areas of Corfu.\n\nPeople in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia",

While studying law at university, he played double-bass in a student band - and developed a reputation as a singer, working in nightclubs and on cruise ships.\n\nBerlusconi had a spell as a singer on cruise ships\n\nHis first foray into using his natural charm for business was as a vacuum cleaner salesman and in selling essays written for his fellow students.\n\nAfter graduation, he started in construction with his own company, Edilnord, building an enormous apartment complex on the edge of Milan - though the source of funding for the project was something of a mystery.\n\nIn 1973, the entrepreneur launched a local cable television company called Telemilano to provide television to his properties.\n\nFour years later, he owned two more stations and a central Milan studio. By the end of the decade, he had created a holding company, Fininvest, to manage the rapid expansion of his business holdings.\n\nEventually, it would own Mediaset - Italy's largest media empire and owner of the country's biggest private stations - and Italy's largest publishing house, Mondadori.\n\nBy the time of his death, he was one of Italy's richest men, with a family fortune in the billions of dollars. His children - Marina, Barbara, Pier Silvio, Eleonora and Luigi - have all taken part in the running of his business empire.\n\nSome of that wealth would be used to indulge his personal interests - including saving his hometown football club AC Milan from bankruptcy in 1986.\n\nThe football club AC Milan was just one of his business interests\n\nThat investment would pay off three decades later in 2017, when he sold the club to Chinese investors for £628m (€740m).\n\nHe never gave up on football either, later buying Monza football club and enjoying its rise to the top flight of Serie A for the first time in its history.\n\nBerlusconi's remarkable ability to face down the courts repeatedly - and maintain his popularity in politics - was unrivalled.\n\nHe often complained of victimisation - particularly by prosecutors in his native Milan - once claiming to have made 2,500 court appearances in 106 trials over 20 years.\n\nCharges over the years have included embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting, and attempting to bribe a judge. He was acquitted or had his convictions overturned on several occasions.\n\nHis controversies were highly public and formed a regular backdrop throughout his political career. It was not until February 2023 that he was finally cleared of bribing witnesses to lie about the notorious \"bunga bunga\" parties he had held at his villa as prime minister.\n\nHe had founded his own political party 30 years earlier in 1993 and within a year, he was catapulted to power.\n\nLeveraging his enthusiasm for football, he named his party after a supporters' chant - Forza Italia (Go Italy). At the time, a power vacuum had emerged in the wake of a scandal affecting Italy's centre-right - and Berlusconi offered an alternative to those voters that was not leftist.\n\nA massive advertising campaign on his own TV channels had helped propel him to victory in the 1994 election.\n\nHowever, his new appetite for politics was seen as a bid to avoid being implicated in corruption charges himself, after several of his businesses were drawn into the investigation.\n\nBut he dismissed the claims. \"I don't need to go into office for the power. I have houses all over the world, stupendous boats, beautiful airplanes, a beautiful wife, a beautiful family. I am making a sacrifice.\"\n\nOnce he was in power, Berlusconi's government passed a law that gave him, and other top public figures, immunity from prosecution while in office, but it was later thrown out by the constitutional court.\n\nBerlusconi's first coalition lasted only a few months - partly owing to friction between the different parties in it, and partly because of Berlusconi's indictment for alleged tax fraud by a Milan court.\n\nHe lost the 1996 election to the Left - but his political career was only just beginning.\n\nIn 2001, Berlusconi was back as prime minister, at the head of a new coalition known as House of Freedoms. The main plank of his election campaign was a promise to overhaul the Italian economy, simplify the tax system and raise pensions.\n\nBut Italy's finances were suffering in a worsening global economy, and Berlusconi was unable to fulfil his pledges. He lost to the Left in 2006 - but won again in 2008.\n\nHe remained a fixture in Italian politics until 2011, which would prove among his most challenging years.\n\nItaly's borrowing costs soared during the eurozone debt crisis. The prime minister haemorrhaged support and was forced to resign after losing his parliamentary majority.\n\nThe same year, the constitutional court struck down part of the law granting him and other senior ministers temporary immunity.\n\nBerlusconi eventually carried out community service as part of his conviction for tax fraud\n\nBy the end of 2011, he was out of power. In October 2012, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for tax fraud and barred from public office. Berlusconi declared his innocence and spoke of a \"judicial coup\".\n\nBut by then, he was over 75 years of age and was handed community service instead. He worked four hours a week with elderly dementia patients at a Catholic care home near Milan.\n\nHe was also banned from public office - a prohibition which lasted for several years before his next comeback.\n\nBeyond politics, Berlusconi made headlines for his private life, which was often very public.\n\nThe flamboyant prime minister did not hide his pursuit of younger women. His most recent partner, party colleague Marta Fascina, is more than 50 years his junior. He was known to use hair transplants and plastic surgery to make himself seem younger.\n\nHe met his second wife, Veronica Lario, after she performed topless in a play. She would go on to express frustration publicly with her husband's behaviour around young women on more than one occasion.\n\nShe filed for divorce after her husband was photographed at the 18th birthday party of model Noemi Letizia.\n\nHis most high-profile scandal was the alleged \"bunga bunga\" parties at his villa, attended by showgirls - a story which ended in a conviction for paying an underage prostitute for sex.\n\nAmid the scandal, both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug denied they had sex\n\nIt eventually emerged that in 2010, Berlusconi, while prime minister, had telephoned a police station and asked for the release of 17-year-old Karima \"Ruby\" El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby Heart-Stealer, who was being held for theft. She was also a reported guest of the \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nItalian media reported that the prime minister had claimed the girl was the niece or granddaughter of the president of Egypt, and he was attempting to avoid a diplomatic incident.\n\nBerlusconi was found guilty of paying her for sex and abusing his power in 2013 - but that ruling was overturned the following year.\n\nFor his part, Berlusconi always rejected claims he had paid any woman for sex, saying to do so was \"missing the pleasure of conquest\". But he also admitted he was \"no saint\".\n\nBeset by national budgetary problems and embroiled in personal scandals, Berlusconi's People of Freedom party did poorly in 2011 local elections, losing",
